# Files Accompanying *Learning The vi and Vim Editors*, Eighth Edition

This repository provides files described in

Many of these files used to be available on the Internet
but are no longer.

published in *UNIX World* magazine in 1990, mentioned a few
times in Part I of the book.

* `vi-powered` - The ``vi Powered'' GIF file meant to adorn
web sites authored with `vi`.

* `amaze-your-friends` - The `vi`-related files originally
available from alf.uib.no and mirrored on uunet.uu.net.

* `clewn-1.15` - The `clewn` debugger assistant that connects
GDB (the GNU debugger) to Vim, via the NetBeans interface. The original
[home page](http://clewn.sourceforge.net) is also online.
