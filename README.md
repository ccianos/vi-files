# Files Accompanying *Learning The vi and Vim Editors*, Eighth Edition

This repository provides files described in
Appendix C of *Learning The vi and Vim Editors*, Eighth Edition.
Many of these files used to be available on the Internet
but are no longer.

Directories included here are:

* `amaze-your-friends` - The `vi`-related files originally
available from alf.uib.no and mirrored on uunet.uu.net.

* `book_examples` - Some of the example files, so that you don't
have to type them in yourself.

* `clewn-1.15` - The `clewn` debugger assistant that connects
GDB (the GNU debugger) to Vim, via the NetBeans interface. The original
[home page](http://clewn.sourceforge.net) is also online.

* `configs` - The configuration files developed by
Elbert Hannah and presented in the book.

* `unix-world-tutorial` - The tutorial on `vi` by Walter Zintz
published in *UNIX World* magazine in 1990, mentioned a few
times in Part I of the book.

* `vi-powered` - The ``vi Powered'' GIF file meant to adorn
web sites authored with `vi`.
