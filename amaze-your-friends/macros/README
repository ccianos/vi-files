All macros in this archive should have an explanantory note 
at the beginning of the macro.

All macros have their author/submiter's email adress included.

Nearly all macros have been tested before they are uploaded to 
the archive.

BEVARE: Some of the macros have been run trough 'cat -v', in those
        cases the macro will not work unless you expand all the 
	CTRL-CHAR to their propper meanig. How to expand should be 
	included with the macro itself. If not do the following: 
	Let's say a macro is written:
              map! ^W ^]:w!i
        to get it to work propperly you must convert ^W and ^]. 
	To convert ^W, type (in textmode) ^V, hold down the CTRL key 
	and type V, relase all keys, hold down the CTRL key once 
	more and type W. Your screen should read ^W.  To get ^] (the 
	ESCAPE key), hold down the CTRL key and press V once again, 
	then press the ESCAPE key. Your screen should read ^] now.


If you wonder how the macro works, contact the author of the
macro, not the archive maintainer.

The archive maintainer IS NOT RESPONSIBLE for any damage the
macros in this archive may cause.
