"
"	Center Text
"
"	:s/^[ ^I]*//^V^M	- substitute at the begin of the line as many
"				  spaces or tabs (^I) as possible with nothing,
"				  i.e. delete them; the return (^M) needs to
"				  be escaped with ^V when typed inside vi;
"				  in the .exrc file there will be a ^M only
"
"	$ma			- go to EOL and mark that position with `a'
"
"	81a ^V^[		- append a space 81 times; just like return the
"				  escape (^[) needs to be escaped
"
"	81^V^V|			- go to column 81; the pipe is the `ex' command
"				  separator; it needs to be escaped when vi is
"				  SCANNING the map to SET it, not when it's
"				  typed in, hence we put a ^V before the pipe;
"				  this ^V has to be typed twice, just because
"				  it's the escape character (if want to change
"				  for a different line length such as 65, then
"				  change the 81 to new line length plus 1, 
"				  ie. 66)
"
"	D			- delete the rest of the line; this is "not an
"				  (`ex') editor command" - it seems you missed
"				  the ^V to escape the preceding pipe!
"
"	`a			- back to the mark
"
"	lx			- delete 1 character to the right (a space)
"
"	d0			- delete to the begin of the line; only the
"				  spaces we appended remain (the number is
"				  80 minus the original line length)
"
"	:s/  / /g^V^M		- halve the number of spaces
"
"	$p^V^M			- go to EOL, put the original line, go to the
"				  next line
"
"	Center text on 70 columns
