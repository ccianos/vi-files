Subject: VI macros for multi-line C-style comments

Here are some vi macros to allow you to make C-style comments 
automatically a la emacs:

	/*  This is a multi-line
 	 *  C-style comment.
	 */

After typing the opening '/*', a macro is tripped which remaps the
return key to automatically indent the next line and properly place the
*'s in a neat column.  The macro is shut off when the closing comment
delimiter '*/' is typed.

This is a grundgy hack- besides a couple macros in your .exrc, there
are two files called ~/.macro-on and ~/.macro-off which contain other
macros.  This is ugly, but I needed some macros to create others and
I ran into trouble trying to put map commands inside map commands.
The fix (if it can be called that) was to :so the macros.

The usefullness of these macros is questionable, but they were fun to
write :-) I use them, but less geeky people might find this a lot of
hassle just to save a few keystrokes.

Please email me if you have any problems/questions/suggestions.

Here is an installation script to install the buggers.  Save the script
and the uuencoded file in a new directory, because a few files will be
created.  The script will copy the macro-on and macro-off files to your
home directory and add some macros to ./.exrc.

Here are the macro files uuencoded.  This is one butt-ugly uuencode,
by the way...
