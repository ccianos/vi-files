" Here's my macro to change the case of the current word;
" the one posted by Bryan Ewbank has the disadvantage that
" it substitutes a tab that may follow the word by a space.
" (This is done by the Join-command.)
" Beware: neither version works for single character words
" like 'a' !
" 
map  lBio-y$+P0Eaxd$:s/./\~/g"zdd-@z--J
" 
" Here's how it works;
" 
" lB	
" 	Go to the start of the word. The 'l' is done in case
" 	we're on the first letter of the word; just 'B' would
" 	move us back to the start of the previous word...
" i^M^[
" 	Split line; word to convert is now at start of next line.
" o^[
" 	Create an empty line below it.
" -y$+P
" 	Move up one line, yank its contents, go to empty line,
" 	and insert yank-buffer.
" 0Eax^[
" 	Move to the start of the line, then to the end of the
" 	word and append an 'x'. This is necessary when the word
" 	to be converted is the last word on a line; otherwise,
" 	'd$' would erase the last character of the word.
" d$
" 	Delete remainder of line, starting at the 'x' we just added.
" :s/./\~/g^M
" 	substitute every character in the word by the '~' character.
" "zdd
" 	Delete line into buffer z.
" -@z
" 	Move up one line and use contents of buffer z as a Vi-command.
" 	'~' is the Vi-command to convert the case of a single character.
" --J
" 	Move back to original line and combine it with the modified part.
