" Subject: vi macros to convert the case of a word
" Date: 6 Sep 88 18:03:28 GMT

" Recently, there was a question about how to convert the case of a word in vi.
" Just for fun, I tried to write a macro...and succeeded!
" 
" Convert ^X to <cntl>X in the sequences below, and :so the file into your
" editor session.  This will map the <cntl>T key into the case conversion
" operation.
" 
" Enjoy.
