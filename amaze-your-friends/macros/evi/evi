The standard UNIX visual display editors vi(1), vedit(1), view(1)
are *much* more powerful than you would think in the first place.
In fact, just like Emacs can be put in a vi mode, vi can be put
in a kind of Emacs mode as shown by the following first attempt to do so.

If only vi was improved in four ways:
 
 1. Make 'h' and 'l' wrap around to other lines

 2. Remove the silly left movement of the cursor when changing from
    input to command mode (which make commands behave differently
    when issued at the leftmost column than in any other column!)

 3. Increase the size of the macro stack by at least a factor of 2

 4. Make 'j' and 'k' ALWAYS move vertically down or up (also if the
    line moved to is empty!)

I would say vi would be the best editor of all.  The full emulation
of Emacs, WordPerfect and other editors/word processors would then
be a piece of cake... (if you really need that).

Comments on my 'evi' script are most welcome.
