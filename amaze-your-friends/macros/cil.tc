" You should try feeding your compiler output into error -v.
" 
" You might consider the following macros as inspirational reading.
" Note expecially the lint macro.

" """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
map 	 \
"	so we can use both ^I and \ for meta-key
"
map \/ dePo/\<pA\>"wdd@w
"	find current word, uses w buffer
"
"	INVERT CASE ON WORDS -- V is like W, v is like w.  3V is fine, but only to EOL.
"	uses both register n and mark n.
map \v ywmnoP:s/./\~/g0"nDdd`n@n
"	abc -> ABC    ABC->abc
map \V yWmnoP:s/./\~/g0"nDdd`n@n
"	abc.xyz -> ABC.XYZ    ABC.XYZ->abc.xyz
"
"
map \@ "mdd@m
"	xqt line as a straight vi command (buffer m, use @@ to repeat)
map \! 0i:r!"ndd@n
"	xqt line as :r! command (buffer n, use @@ to repeat)
"
map \t :r!cat /dev/tty
"	read in stuff from X put buffer
"	
"	LINT MACRO.  deletes all text from "lint output:" and below, (if any)
"	replacing it with lint output in pretty block comment form.  could
"	do sed work myself, but this is faster.  
"
"	the map! is for subsequent map, not by people, 
"	tho /o would make sense.
"	this is one of those famous time/space tradeoffs 
"
map! o lint output
"
"	and now for the real work
map \l Go/* o/odG:wo/*** o<<:r!lint -u -lc %|sed 's/^/ *  /'Go***/N
"
"	indent this for me
"
map \i :%!indent -i4
"
"	COMMENTING MACROS -- these are actually pretty amazing
"
"	from edit mode, this comments a line
map ^X ^i/* A */^
"
"	and this undoes it
map ^Y :s/\/\* \([^*]*\) \*\//\1
"
"	this next one defeats vi's tail-recursion defeatism
"	called by 2 maps following this one 
map! ^N :unmap! 
"
"	while in insert mode, this will put you "inside" a comment
map! ^X :map!  a^Noa /*  */hhi
"
"	while in edit mode, this begins a block comment -- ^N to escape
map \c	O/* *  */k:map!  *  A
"
"	and this is for adding more lines to a block comment -- ^N to escape
map \o	:map! ^M ^M*  A
