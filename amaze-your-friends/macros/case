" Hi Again --
" 
" Several people have provided corrections to my case conversion macro.  In order
" that a correct version be available, I am reposting with the corrected version
" of the macros.  They are:
" ----------------------------------------
" map	^C	: ^W -- reverse the case of the current word
" map	^C	: ^T -- reverse  the case of the current line.
" map	^C	: a more elegant definition for ^T is
" map	^C	: 	!!tr '[a-z][A-Z]' '[A-Z][a-z]'^M
" map	^C	: but this trashes the screen display sometimes
map  0y$Pa-:s/./\~/g"0zy$dd@z
map  lBiEa-I ^d0-3J
" ----------------------------------------
" Before :so'ing the above, convert the following characters:
"
" ######
" #
" # This have been done by the ARCHIVE MAINTAINER
" #
" ###### 
"         ^ C	==>  <cntl> C	[or these lines can be discarded]
"         ^ M	==>  <cntl> M
"         ^ T	==>  <cntl> T
"         ^ W	==>  <cntl> W
"         ^ [	==>  <esc>
" NOTE: ^d **really** is a carat (^) followed by a lowercase d.
" 
" The ^W macro will reverse the case of the current word (the word that contains
" the cursor).  The ^T macro will reverse the case of the current line.
" 
" Thanks to all of the people who sent me suggestions and bug reports.  I hope
" that these two macros work better.
" 
" The alternate definition of the ^T macro [using tr(1)] causes vi to get
" confused when the operation is done in the first line of a file that is less
" than about 20 lines long.  The contents of the file is correctly translated,
" but the screen is corrupted with duplicate copies of the last few lines of the
" file.
" 
" A detailed rundown of the operations of the macros is available on request.
