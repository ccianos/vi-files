" Of course, Tom's solution is the best I've seen using standardly availably

" My macro goes like:
map \s :w! /tmp/spl%:!ispell /tmp/spl%:%!cat /tmp/spl%:!rm /tmp/spl%
" 
" 
" Still possible for name collision, etc... (i.e. far from perfect), but I
" like it. I've forgotten, though, the character for a macro that says "Eat
" the next pause" for the "Press Return to Continue" prompt.  I've seen it
" before, and heard that it is better that just sending an extra <cr>, but
" none of the manuals/docs have it, and I didn't see it in any of the macro
" files on the vi archive...anyone know/remember?
