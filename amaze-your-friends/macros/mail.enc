Hi,

Meanwhile, here are some scripts so you won't be too angry at me:


The ecrypt program:

#! /bin/sh

case $# in
  0 ) compress -c | des -e | uuencode version.3 ;;
  1 ) compress -c | des -e -k $1 | uuencode version.3 ;;
  * ) echo $USAGE ; exit 1 ;;
esac





The dcrypt program:

#!/bin/sh

# dcrypt    De-crypt a uuencoded, compressed msg

tname=/tmp/dc_$$
oname=/tmp/dc_$$.x

trap "/bin/rm -f $tname $oname ; exit 1"  1 2 3 6 7 8 13 14 15 16 18 19

argv=$#
key=$1

cat - > $tname

version=`egrep -e "^begin" < $tname`
set $version
version=$3

sed '1,$s;'$version';'$oname';' < $tname | uudecode

case $version in
  version.1 )
    crypt $key < $oname ;;
  version.2 )
    crypt $key < $oname | uncompress -c ;;
  version.3 )
    case $argv in
      0)  des -d < $oname | uncompress -c ;;
      *)  des -d -k $key < $oname | uncompress -c ;;
    esac ;;
esac
/bin/rm -f $tname $oname




And the vi macros to use these programs:

After composing a mail message using vi, I use a macro to pass the body
of the message through the ecrypt script.  The first vi macro in figure 2
is for encrypting.  When this macro is active, typing ``;ec'' while editing
a mail message in vi will send the body of the message (without the message
header) through the ecrypt script.  First it jumps to the top of the text
buffer and searches for a blank line.  This step skips the mail header at
the top of the message.  Then it prepares to pipe the message through the
ecrypt script, but allows you to type an encryption key if you want.

Note that there is a trailing space after the !ecrypt in this macro.  I
usually type in the encryption key, then immediately type return.
However, typing return without entering the key allows des to prompt
for the key; this latter usage is more secure because the clear text of
the key never appears on your screen (or in memory).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
map ;ec 1G/^$^Mj:.,$!ecrypt
map ;dcr :%s/^>//^M1G/^begin^M:.,$!dcrypt
map ;dc 1G/^begin^M:.,$!dcrypt

Figure 2.  Vi macros for ecrypt and dcrypt
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second macro assumes that you are editing a reply to an encrypted
message and strips off the ``>'' quoting character that some mailers
add when creating a reply.  My mailer, m6, is configured for this
message quoting scheme.  After stripping the quotation characters, the
macro goes to the top of the buffer and searches for the text ``begin''
at the begining of a line.  This key word signals the begining of the
uuencoded body of the message, and the script pipes this text into the
dcrypt program.

Once again, the script pauses after entering the dcrypt command,
allowing you to enter the decryption key.  If no key is entered, i.e.
you just hit the return key, des will prompt you for a key. This method
makes the decryption process somewhat more secure.

The last macro does not assume the text is quoted but otherwise
prepares it for dcrypt and works just like the ``;dcr'' macro.
