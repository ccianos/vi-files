" The [ ones create the macro on the next line, then delete it (to the
" z buffer), so the current file *gets* changed.
" The \ ones write to a tmpfile (assume that current file *hasn't* been
" changed, or they will fail).
" The z ones search for the string as a reg exp.
" The Z ones search for the string as a discrete word.
" 
" They operate from the next line on.
