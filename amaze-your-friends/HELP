       HELP ON USING THE MAIL INTERFACE AT VI/EX ARCHIVE alf.uib.no
       ************************************************************

 BEWARE: If you have anon. ftp capability, please use that instead of
         this mailserver (see below).

 VI/EX Archive alf.uib.no, and its mirrors have the most complete, and
 the biggest publically available archive containing VI/EX stuff.

 To access the mailer, just send a mail message to ruben@uib.no.
 You have two ways of fetching files:
    1) Single file.
    2) Multiple files.


 Single file request
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 In the Subject field in your header of your message you simply put 
 GET <filename>.

 Example of a simple request to get the INDEX file:

 unix%                              or:
 unix% mail ruben@uib.no          To: ruben@uib.no
 Subject: GET INDEX               Subject: GET INDEX
 .
 unix%


 Multiple file request
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 In the Subject field in your header put MULTIGET or MGET.
 Then in your message you put several GET <filename>.

 Example of a multiple file request:

 unix%                              or:
 unix% mail ruben@uib.no          To: ruben@uib.no
 Subject: MULTIGET                Subject: MULTIGET

 GET INDEX                        GET INDEX
 GET HELP                         GET HELP
 GET macros/ctags.Z               GET macros/ctags.Z
 .
 unix%

 
 The old Mailserver did send a Control File for each file requested. This
 is not so anymore. Now the Controll information will be embedded into the
 message itself.

 DO NOT request the whole archive! If you request the whole archive all 
 at one time I will report you to your site admin. There is a limit of
 10 files in a MULTIGET.
 If you do want the whole archive, please contact me first and we will
 work out something.

 Before fetching a file, think: "Do I realy need this file, or is it just
 'nice to have it' ?"

 Most files will be run thru uuencode (1) before mailng, even textfiles.
 To extract a requested file, use the command uudecode (1).

 If you do not get a reply within a reasonable time, please do not send
 another request for the file(s). 

 Please report any problems or question to ruben@uib.no. But remeber to
 never put "GET" or "MGET" or "MULTIGET" in the Subject of the message.
 Rather put in "Mailserver problem", if I'm online I will get a imediate 
 notification that such message is in my mail-bucket. 
 A lot of my mail are simply put into the bucket without imediate action.

 FTP:
   Remeber that those who allow anon-ftp are very kind. Please do not
   misuse or abuse this privilege.
   Think twice before downloading, esp if you are a long-distance ftp' er.

   If you are going to use FTP, use the site that is the closest to you
   counting NET-VICE. If you don't know what I'm talking about, please 
   ask someone who does (like  your system administrator).

   IF YOU HAVE FTP-ACCESS, DO *NOT* USE THE MAILSERVER. Not even if you
   temporarily cannot reach alf.uib.no or its mirrors.
   The mirroring sites are always promptly updated.

   Why YOU shold use the site closest to you NET-VICE:
 	- Faster access.
 	- Reducing the net load.
 	- Keeping the site on the net. 

   The main archive is in Bergen, Norway, EUROPE. 
   alf.uib.no is mirrored at sites around the world. If you find a
   site nearer to you than alf.uib.no, please use that site. 
   The mirroing sites are ALWAYS updated.

   Please do NOT use ftp to the sites during peak hours at the various 
   locations. Please respect this because if there is too much ftp'ing 
   going on in prime time to the various places, the ftp site may have to 
   shut down.  NONE OF US WOULD WANT THAT, WOULD WE ?
