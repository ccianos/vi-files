     Vi,  pronounced  ``vee-eye'',  is  a  full-screen   text   editor
     available  on UNIX.  Vi lets you view and edit many lines of text
     at once, and is generally faster to use than line editors.

     You can use vi to create, change and  manipulate  files.   Vi  is
     called the visual editor because you can see, move and change any
     text  on  the  screen.   You  can  also  access  the  power   and
     flexibility of the line editor, ex, from within vi.

     To use the visual editor you must have a video  display  terminal
     which understands full-screen terminal control signals and has an
     addressable  cursor.   Or  you  must  have   a   workstation   or
     microcomputer  that  emulates  such  a  terminal.  There are many
     microcomputer programs that only emulate a dumb  line-mode  (TTY)
     terminal.  The full screen mode of the editor cannot be used with
     these dumb terminal emulators.

     A number of documents and  short  courses,  as  well  as  on-line
     exercises  and  a  practice  file, are available to assist you in
     learning vi.

     On-Line Learn Exercises
          A series of several dozen interactive exercises can be  used
          to  learn  vi.   To  try these exercises, leave ``help'' (by
          typing ``%''), and then type ``learn vi''.

     Practice File (for a taste of vi)
          An easy way to begin  learning  cursor  movements  and  some
          simple  vi  commands is to practice using vi on our prepared
          practice file.  To do this, type ``vi_practice'' from within
          help or type ``help vi_practice'' from the shell.

     Computer Center Short Courses
          Each semester the Computer Center offers a  series  of  UNIX
          short  courses,  including  an  introduction  to  vi  called
          ``Using the UNIX Visual Editor, vi''.  Type _h_e_l_p _c_l_a_s_s_e_s for
          the current class schedule.
