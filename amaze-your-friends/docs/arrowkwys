[explanation of why this happens, deleted]

Try putting this in your .exrc file

map! ^[OA ^[ka
map! ^[OB ^[ja
map! ^[OC ^[la
map! ^[OD ^[ha

Where ^[ is the Esape character (^V Escape)


Anyone else have any handy hints like this?

Sometimes, when you are in command mode,  you  will  notice  that
arrow key insert 'B', or 'C', or other letters. It comes from the
fact that your arrow keys give the sequence ^[OA (or B,C,D),  but
too slowly to be understood. Try to set the timeout variable:

:set notimeout (or :set noto)

You will notice that when  you  press  Esc  key  after  that,  vi
doesn't switch immediatly. You just have to keep on typing, so vi
see that you are not using arrow keys.

Also, put in a similar set of lines for other types of terminals:

map! ^[[A ^[ka
map! ^[[B ^[ja
map! ^[[C ^[la
map! ^[[D ^[ha
