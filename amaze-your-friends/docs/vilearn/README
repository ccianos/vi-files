We have a mailing list, vilearn-admins@terminator.cc.umich.edu. To be
added to the list, send mail to vilearn-admins-request@terminator.  The
list is intended to discuss the tutorials, coordinate projects relating
to them, and provide help to those who may need it.

We hope you enjoy and profit from these tutorials.  It is unfortunate
that we did not profit from them in any way. We would like to sincerely
thank the Information Technology Division of the University of
Michigan, a huge bureaucracy with a budget exceeding two million
dollars.  We offered ITD complete ownership of these tutorials,
including user testing and staff training sessions, for the
contemptibly small fee of two thousand dollars. For some reason, they
could not justify the cost...
