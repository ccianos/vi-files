>From the keyboard of olsonkk@ucsu.Colorado.EDU (OLSON KIRK):
:Hi all... I was wondering if anyone knew if a spellchecker for VI exists
:and or is available?  Has anyone ever heard of such a thing?

I use these macros:

"       SPELL MACROS
"
map \s :w^Mgo^V^[:$r!spell %^M
"       spell the file, placing errors at bottom, use \n to find
map \n Gdd\/
"       for find next spelling error
map \/ dePo/\<^V^[pA\>^V^["wdd@w
"       find current word, uses w buffer


Of course, the ^V should be literal control-V's, etc.

Let's give out a bootable, stand-alone version of GNU emacs, then come 
back in 9 months and find whoever's using it -- and kill them.
