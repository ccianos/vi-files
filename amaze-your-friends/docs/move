I have prepared some Helpful Hint files on common problems of moving
text around from file to file or within a file.  Perhaps, they may  
be helpful.  Thus, I post the three files here.  Enjoy.

These were posted and made available on this machine for all to use.

            How to Move Text from One File to Another in VI

Frequently, a question arises, how do I move a block of text from
file1 to somewhere  within file2.  This note will give you one way
of performing this task using the vi editor.

For example, you may have a procedure defined in file1 and you would
like to make use of it in a program contained in file2.

file1 and file2 refer to arbitrary file names.  Substitute the names
of the source file containing the text you want to copy for "file1"
in the instructions below and the name of the target file where
you want to copy the stuff into "file2"

This will consist of starting file1 up with vi, copying the block
of text to a temporary file.  Then you will read the temporary file
into the appropriate location in file2.

1. Get into file1 by typing "vi file1"

2. Move the cursor to the first line in the region to be copied.

3. Press "ma"

4. Move the cursor to the last line (bottom line) of the region to
   be copied.

5. Type the following sequence of characters
   :'a,.w /tmp/xxx

   You may use any name you want instead of xxx

    The machine will display a message at bottom of screen beginning
    with "/tmp/xxx" [New file]
   and then tell you how many lines and chars you put in this temporary
    file.

6. Leave vi.  You can use the sequence ":wq" for this purpose.

7. Now get into file2 by typing "vi file2"

8. Move the cursor to the line just before you want to add the
   text

9. Type the following sequence of characters
   :r/tmp/xxx

All done!

                How to Move Text From One part of a file to another

This Helpful Hint tells you how to use Vi to move some text from
one part of a file to another.  It assumes you are familiar with the
basics of vi, e.g., moving the cursor around.   

Note that this moves text from one part of a file to another.   See
Leff's Helpful Hint Three for information on moving information from
one file to a different file.  (You can read this by typing 
cat ~mflll/lhh3
 
If you would like to do a "copy" of text-
, see Leff's Helpful Hint Six.  (You can read this
by typing
cat ~mflll/lhh6

A "copy" differs from a "move" in that after a copy, there will be
a copy of the text in the original location of the file as well as the
place to which you are copying the text.
 
There is only a one character difference between the
sequences of instructions to copy and to move text.
 
1) Get into vi on the file.

2) Move the cursor to the beginning of the text to be moved

3) type "ma"

4) Move the cursor the end of the text to be moved

5) Type the sequence

"ad'a

6) Now move the cursor to the location where you want the text to be.
Specifically, the cursor should be on the line that should be before
the text being moved.

7) Now type the sequence

"ap

ALL DONE!

                How to Copy Text From One part of a file to another

This Helpful Hint tells you how to use Vi to copy some text from
one part of a file to another.  It assumes you are familiar with the
basics of vi, e.g., moving the cursor around.   

Note that this copy text from one part of a file to a new location in
the same file.

See
Leff's Helpful Hint Three for information on moving information from
one file to a different file.  (You can read this by typing 
cat ~mflll/lhh3

If you would like to do a "move" of text--where the text is no longer
in the old position, see Leff's Helpful Hint Five.  (You can read this
by typing
cat ~mflll/lhh5
 
There is only a one character difference between these two
sequences of instructions.
 
1) Get into vi on the file.

2) Move the cursor to the beginning of the text to be moved

3) type "ma"

4) Move the cursor the end of the text to be moved

5) Type the sequence

"ay'a

6) Now move the cursor to the location where you want the text to be.
Specifically, the cursor should be on the line that should be before
the text being moved.

7) Now type the sequence

"ap

ALL DONE!
