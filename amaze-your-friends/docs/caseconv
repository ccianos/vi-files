Hi there

	i read of a way to convert ALL upper case letters to lower case in the 
	file in VI in one shot (not using ~ which works per charater) on the 
	net somewhere but forgot it. i shall be very grateful if someone mails 
	me how to do that.

Sorry, in my previous response, I converted all characters to uppercase.
To convert them to lower case, use:

	:%s/./\l&/g
