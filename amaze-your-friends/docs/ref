                       Characters using buffers

d obj	  delete object	      dd     delete line
y obj      yanks object	      yy     yank line
p	  place what is in buffer
"         select buffer

NOTE:  There are 26 buffers, each corresponding to a letter of the
       alphabet. To refer to a specific buffer type "<letter> e.g. "a
       refers to buffer a.  Therefore "add would delete the line that
       cursor is on and place it into buffer a.  To place the deleted
       line elsewhere, position cursor and type "ap.

       In order to delete or yank a section of text, you must place a
       mark to where the deletion/yank is to stop.  This is done by
       typing: m<letter> (do not use the same buffer to place a mark
       and store text). To return to that location, type `<letter>.
       When deleting or yanking to a mark, say b, position the
       cursor at the beginning of the desired text, and type "ad`b.
       This deletes the text from cursor until mark b, and places it
       in buffer a.  "ad'b will delete until the end of the line in
       which mark b is (note difference in ` and ').



                            Search

/text<CR> search forward for text     ?text<CR> search backward
n	  next occurance	      N         next occurance in 
						  opposite direction

                        Miscellaneous

J     adjoin current line to line above
!!    place results of command into file i.e. !!cat it.p will place
           the list of it.p in your file.
