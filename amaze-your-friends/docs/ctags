Subject: Help need in using CTAGS !
Date: Thu, 6 Aug 1992 15:23:30 GMT

Hi,

Please, I need some help! using CTAGs in unix:

If I recursively invoke tags (by typing "CNTRL ]" on each
identifier I wish to search for), say 3 times, I am unable
to "pop back" to the file where I *first* invoked tags. 

When I was on campus, it used to work the way I wanted 
it to, but now on my job, when I create a tags file and
invoke it in a nested (recursive) fashion, I'm only able
to "pop back" to the *previous* file where tags was invoked.

Also, invoking tags seem to be case sensitive ie. identifier
"Ct" is not treated the same as "ct". Is there a way to make it
case insensitive?

Anybody ever had these experiences, or knows how to
overcome these problems ?

Your help will be very much appreciated !


Thanks,
Michael.

I have a problem using named buffers in vi (SunOs 4.11), perhaps someone 
can shed some light on this. First I'll tell you the circumstances which led 
me to find this problem ...

A short while ago, Michael Samchee submitted the following news article...

I too had a the same problem and came up with the following simple solution.
However I didn't post the article because vi did not always behave as I
expected. Before I describe the problem led me show what was to be my original
posting.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
In your .exrc file or EXINIT parameter add the following 2 mappings

map ^A mzywo^[pI:!exec vi -t ^["zdd`z@z
map ^K :q!^M^M			# if too risky, force yourself to type :q! 
map ^W :!exec listtags

where listtags is a shell script to display vi's -t option argument from
a ps listing. eg on a Sun, this works...
    ps | grep 'vi -t' | grep -v grep | awk '{ print $NR }'
( This was an afterthought and is admittedly a bit ropey )

To use, type:
<ctrl-A> on the identifier you want to tag to, like ^]. 
<ctrl-K> takes you back. 
<ctrl-W> gives you a listing of the tags stack. 

Obviously you could use your own preferrences to ^A,^K and ^W. 

Perhaps you would appreciate an explanation of the first macro.

mz		-  mark cursor position as point z
eb     		-  put cursor on first character of word (end, beginning) 
yw		-  yank word into unnamed buffer
o	  	-  open a line
^[		-  <esc> come out of edit mode
p		-  put back yanked word
I:!exec vi -t ^[-  insert before word :!exec vi -t
"zdd		-  delete line into buffer z
		   ( buffer now contains `:!exec vi -t *identifier*' )
`z              -  Put cursor back to original spot z
@z		-  Run contents of buffer z as ex command. 

As for the case insensitivity you could change the macro so that the command
line becomes

	:!exec vi -t `echo *identifier* | tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"`

but this would only work if you had previously de-capitalized the first word on each line of your tags file. A simple shell script could could be used to 
create a new lower case tags file, say lctags, and the :se tags=lctags command 
in vi could be used to change the file searched when tagging.

Now when testing these macros I found they worked well most of the
