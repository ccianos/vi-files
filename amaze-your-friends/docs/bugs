Today I discovered a mysterious bug in vi on both SunOS 4.1.1 and
4.1.2.  Marking a position in a file with letter d, moving below the
marked line, and performing c'd causes segmentation violation.

Funny enough, by using any other letter than d for the mark, or `d
instead of 'd as the cursor movement command, things work the way
they're supposed to.

Any comments?

This seems to be a generic bug in vi, since it does the same thing on a
NeXT station (vi version 3.7). I find it is interesting, because I have
been using vi for almost 6 years, and have found it very difficult to do
something which would dump a core file without a lot of work. BTW, I did
the same command in vile (my current editor of choice), and it did the
right thing.
