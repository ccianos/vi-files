Hi there,

A few days ago I sent the following news item asking for help on
using CTAGS in VI:

Based on email and newsgroup replies, I would like to share
the following solution with you:

First of all, it seem to be general concensus that tag stacking 
is only available on newer versions of vi. 

Since we don't have access to the source for vi, the following
solution, given by

           "s-fujii@sramha.sra.co.jp (Seigo Fujii)"

can be used to solve the problem:

First,

Map a key (say ^Y) to push the file on the stack and invoke tags:
    map ^Y  :1,.w !exec vifs push %^M^M^]

Map a key (say ^P) to pop the previous file from the stack:
    map ^P  :!exec vifs pop^M:so ~/tmp/vifs_pop.ex^M^M

Create a directory called "tmp" in your home directory,
and put the following perl script program (given at the end
of this news item) in a file and name it "vifs".

You can now use ^Y to invoke tags and ^P to pop back
to the *previous* file where tags was invoked.

As for the last problem in the original posting, no one was
able to give a solution to making tags case insensitive..

Cheers,
Michael.

I just wrote a edit-file stack macro set and perl script to do it.

But, I can not solve this problem.

macro usage:
    #+	: push edit file name and current line number.
    #-	: pop back to last pushed file and line.
    #=	: show edit file stack.
    #^]	: push and tag jump.
    #^^	: synonym of #-.

vifs command usage:
    vifs, vifs show	: printout stack to stdout.
	# Each vi process use different workfile by pid.
    vifs push FILE	: push FILE.
	Count line of stdin then write file name and line number
	to workfile. 
    vifs pop		: pop back.
	Pop file name and line number from workfile then make a
	ex command file to back to poped file. 
    vifs clear		: clear stack.
    vifs clean		: remove all workfiles.
	# If you don't "vifs clean", some day system remove # files.
