	I just started using an NCD xterm recently. I am running the
    olwm. I am a dedicated vi user. But now I cannot use any of the
    keys that I mapped because apparently the keyboard keys of interest
    like (find, next Screen, Prev Screen, etc....) do not produce any
    output. Could some body please help me out....I hope my message 
    was clear....If not please no flames...

    thanks,
