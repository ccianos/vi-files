In the replacement string:

  \l	changes the case of the next letter to lower case
  \u	changes the case of the next letter to lower case
  \L	changes case to lower case until \e or \E or end of replacement
  \U	changes case to upper case until \e or \E or end of replacement

  &	denotes the string that matched the search pattern
  ~	denotes the previous replacement string

  \1	denotes the string that matched the part of the search string
	between the leftmost \( and the corresponding \)
  \2	ditto for second \(
  \3	ditto for third \(
  :	:	:
  :	:	:

Thus :s/pattern/\U&/g changes all occurrences of "pattern" to upper case,
