I think I named everybody whom I have received mail from up to this point
in time. If your name isn't here, I either didn't get your mail or managed
to miss typing your name above. If the latter is the case, sorry.

A note on this text. Control characters will be typed as
<ctrl>c for control c or similarly <esc> for escape. All
commands or characters which are imbedded in text will be
in single quotes, for example 'H' means to type capitol h,
not quote H quote. I'll probably mess this up at least once,
but you should be able to work out what I meant :-)

Here's the "best" tip of all, it involves work, but still.......

------------
Use the tilde ~  to change case (upper/lower) of letters. It will ignore
punctuation.
------------
Reverse 2 characters in a word with 'xp'. I remember this as an abbreviation
of the word transpose.
------------
When editing 2 file, switch between them with ':e#' or '<ctrl>^' . The latter
does not always work due to differences in terminals.
------------
Use the caret '^' and dollar '$' to match beginning of line and end of line in
ed style substitutions. For example:
  :%s/^/>  /
places a '>  ' at the front of every line in the buffer.
------------
Move to the bottom of the file with 'G'.
Move to the top of the file with '1G'
Move to the top of the screen with 'H' or <home>
Move to the middle of the screen with 'M'
Move to the end of the screen with 'L'
------------
Re-format text using the '!}fmt' command. This one will re-format a paragraph.
'!]]fmt' does the rest of the buffer. '!)fmt' does a sentence.
------------
Much mail concerned the use of ranges in vi commands. For example consider
the 'd', delete, command.

'dw' deletes a word
'dG' deletes to bottom of file
'd)' deletes a sentence.  Sentences are delimited by TWO spaces.
'd%' deletes to the matching bracket, brace, or paren. Works
     forwards or backwards.
'd''' (that's d with 2 single quotes) Deletes to the last place we
      jumped from. For example, find the first line to delete, place
      the curser on that line. Jump using a '/pattern' search. Type
      'd''', the lines between those points will be deleted.
'd]]' deletes the rest of the buffer
'dtp' deletes through the letter p, but leaves the p
'dfp' deletes to and including the letter p

The search operation may be used also:

'd/pattern<esc>' deletes up to the patern, but leaves the pattern.

The neat thing about this principle is it works with most other vi commands
such as 'y' yank, and 'c' change.
