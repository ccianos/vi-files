Air-conditioning in the Unix Computer Room is still broken.  All four microvax
computers were kept running during the weekend; the temperature was hotter
than comfortable, but luckily is within the working limits of the equipment.
All non-necessary equipment will be turned off during non-working hours.
This means PostScript printers (ps,rps) will not work except 8-5 Mon-Fri.
The regular printers in the Unix Lab (137) will not be effected.
