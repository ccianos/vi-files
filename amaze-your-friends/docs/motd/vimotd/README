Introduction

"vimotd" is a command that is added to an "etc" directory via "make install".
This command allows the person who runs it to modify a "global motd file",
which is a special format message-of-the-day file.  After editing this file,
vimotd generates individual host motd files and sends them to each host
via NFS.  This command acts very much like "vipw" under Berkeley Unix,
hence its name.

"vimotd" can only be run by a user who has write-permission to the
/etc/motd files on each host.  "vimotd" is a shell-script which you should
configure before installing.  It must be able to "cd" into its working
directory to get to its awk script and global motd file.


Benefits of this package

vimotd allows the system administrator to manipulate many host's /etc/motd
files by maintaining only a single text file using the vi editor.

The command "vimotd" is very easy to type, is shorter than actually editing
a single /etc/motd file, and works no matter what directory you are
currently in.

The first line of each host's existing /etc/motd file is preserved when the
new motd files are written back out to each host.

NFS is used to read and write the motd files to remote hosts, although
other facilities may be used.

The ability to add a single message to existing /etc/motd files
on one or many hosts.

The ability to comment out lines in the motd file so that they aren't
placed in the actual motd files, but can be kept around for future use.

The ability to use host aliases which group a number of machines into one
name, such as "mv" for "all microvax type computers", or "fac" for "faculty".

The "ping" utility is required to sense if each remote host is accessable.

All resulting motd files have an extra blank line separating each group
of message lines, and have an extra blank line at the top and bottom of
the file.  This makes the resulting motd files more readable for people
when they log in.


Installation

* Edit the vimotd file and set NFSPATH to the prefix portion of the path
  that accesses all remote host's root directories.  Example: for a remote
  host "mv1", if the path to its root directory is /r/mv1, then put:
	NFSPATH=/r

* Edit the motd.nawk file and set up the "hosts" array as described
  within that file.

* Decide where you want to put the vimotd executable program.
  Modify the BIN variable in the Makefile to know this.

* Decide where you want the working directory for vimotd to be.
  Modify the MOTDDIR variable in the Makefile to know this.
  Modify the MOTDDIR variable in the vimotd shell-script to know this.

* Inspect everything in the Makefile, and modify as appropriate.

* Type "make install", then "make installdir" to install everything.

* Test out vimotd.  If using the C-shell, you probably have to type
  "rehash" or log out and back in for the command to be recognized.
  Then type "vimotd" and see what happens.  You should be in vi,
  editing the global motd file, and when you quit it should write out
  all the individual host's motd files.


Format of the Global Motd File

The format of the global motd file you edit is as follows:

	1. Lines beginning with "#" are considered comments and ignored.

	2. Lines beginning with ">>" contain zero or more white-space
	   separated hostnames or host abbreviations after it on the line.

	3. Lines below the ">>" line up to the next ">>" or end-of-file
	   are written to the motd files listed on the previous ">>" line.
	   This includes blank lines.

	4. All lines above the first ">>" line are ignored, because no hosts
	   have been specified yet.

	5. A lone ">>" on a line with no host names or abbreviations following
	   it causes all lines below it up to the next ">>" line to be ignored.
