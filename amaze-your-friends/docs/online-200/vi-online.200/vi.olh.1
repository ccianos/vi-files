" INSTALLATION:
"
"    Copy the files  vi.{olh,ende,help} to /usr/local/lib.
"    If you don't want them there, change the path. No need to mailing the
"    author for this.
"
"    Put   map  :source /usr/local/lib/vi.olh   in your ~/.exrc or your
"    EXINIT or other places where you need the vi online manual.
"    Everytime you hit CTRL-H in command mode you will load the help-system.
"
"    When entering ^H or other controll characters in vi, type ^V before
"    you enter your controll char.
"
"    After doing this you are ready to use the on-line help system

" THIS SYTEM WORKS ON:
"
"    SunOS 4.1.1    - 4/75
"    HP-UX A.B7.00  - B9000/825 /834
"    bsd 4.3        - Unknown
"  
"
"
" HOW THIS WORKS:
"
"    The 'g' macro start's it all after first reading inn the helpfile.
"    It works like this: Yank the differenct sections into different
"    buffers. Map various controll-keys to display various sections.
"
"    After assiging to different buffers, we source the file vi.ende to 
"    get rid of the various temporary mappings.
