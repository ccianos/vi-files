   Okay the information I will be giving you concerns the vi
editor I got off of gatekeeper.dec.com in the directory:
pub/VMS/vitpu-v5.  The editor is a front-end on tpu and installed
bare minimum takes 250k of disk.  Installed as the designer intended
(all doc files, neat cld to add to dcl) it takes about 560k.

  The installation is very easy.  However, for a complete install where
you change dcltables and use the install utility, you will need SYSPRV,
and probably CMKRNL privs.  Since I am the only vi user on my system (a vax 
8550, about 200 users) it seemed a waste to redefine dcltables and install
something for one person.  Fortunately,  the tpu section can be set up without
all that fanfare.  I just commented out the install line in the make.com
file.

  The editor itself has ex and vi modes, and it lets you have the
equivalent of a .exrc/.virc to set up you own environment.  I have not
used it extensively yet, but all the basic editing, searching, and replacing
stuff seems to work fine.  The search case sensitivity is a little different
from what I am used to (vi on Ultrix 4.* and SunOS 4.x) but that is minor.
The package also defaults to be your VMS mail editor, which is nice.

  One of the replies to my post was from the author of vitpu
(gregg@cbnewsc.cb.att.com), and he seemed
like he would not mind helping if there were problems.  I did not contact
him though, since I ran into no difficulties.  Feel free to mail me if you
need more information.
