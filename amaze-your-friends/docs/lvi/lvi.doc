This is a macro package  providing a learner's  interface to
the  vi(1)   editor   family.  You  start  by  typing   'lvi
<filename(s)>'.  'Lvi'  will then  create a specific  EXINIT
variable  and run  vi(1)  through  an  exec(1)  command.  If
available,  the 'showmode'  flag will be set in vi(1).  When
vi(1) has  started a tags file  containing  an  introductory
text  will  be   displayed.  After  that,  just  follow  the
instructions.

'Lvi' is adaptive in the sense that the first time you enter
a command  that in some way  might  change  the text you are
editing you will get interactive help with the command.  You
can even safely gain some  experience  by trying the command
on the help text.  Any text changes introduced at this stage
will be silently  discarded.  After this  exercise,  you are
supposed to be familiar with the particular command and will
not get any special help the next time you use it.  However,
at any time you can type '^a' (<CTRL>a) to get assistance in
form of an on-line, single-screen vi(1) help card containing
virtually  every standard vi(1)  command.  A TeX source file
for this help card is made  available  so you can typeset it
and keep it in your shirt pocket.

The  adaptiveness of 'lvi' has been  accomplished  by having
all   text-changing   commands  either   ":map"ped  away  or
":map"ped to a ":ta" command that copies in a tags file with
help text and  examples.  Only if you use a ":"  command  is
it possible to damage the tags file.  It does not seem to be
possible  to ":map"  the ":"  command  itself to make  'lvi'
completely  safe.  At least on the system (HP-UX) I used for
developing  'lvi', such a mapping  yields the  message  "Too
dangerous to map that".

After hitting '^c' you enter into the first of the files you
want to edit.  At the same time a help line is displayed  at
the bottom of the screen.  This line also  appears  when you
hit <CR> in command mode, something that unexperienced users
tend to do now and  then.  Except  for the fact  that  '^a',
'^c',  '<CR>',  'v', 'V', and 'q' are  mapped  to  something
useful, 'lvi' now behaves like  standard  vi(1).  This means
that you may in fact use 'lvi' to produce useful text files.
