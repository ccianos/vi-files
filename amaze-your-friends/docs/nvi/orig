Subject: Novice vi(1) script with on-line help

This is 'nvi', a novice 'vi' script including on-line command help (the part
that presents all 'vi' commands fits on a 80x24 screen).  We have put 'nvi'
in /usr/local/bin and the help text in /usr/local/lib/vi.  I also include
TeX source code for the 'vi' command help card.  Run it and photo-copy it
on a cardboard sheet, fold it, and keep it available in your shirt pocket.

Comments/corrections welcome. Enjoy!

-Bo

PS. If you don't have the non-expert 'vi' version 'vedit' on your UNIX,
replace 'vedit' by 'vi' in the 'nvi' script!
