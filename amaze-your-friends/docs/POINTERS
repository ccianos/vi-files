This file contain POINTERS to other archives that have stuff not
included here.

Since this archive is mainly stuffed with League for Programming Freedom,
and VI stuff there is a limit of what other types of stuff I can include.

Of course I would gladly include a lot of other material for text editing,
editor constructions, VI-clones, etc.etc.
Instead of using a lot of disk, a lot of my time beeing updated I will
put pointers to this kind of products/files.
