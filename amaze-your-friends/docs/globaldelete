Hi vi-ers,
I'll keep this short and sweet.
Problem:
   :g/string/d   in macro buffer, when invoked gives the error:
 "Can't undo in global commands"

Details:
   I open an empty line and type the following:
              :g/string/d
   and then I delete the line to buffer "a by entering   
              ESC "add
   Then I get the said error when I enter
              @a

The command works normally when I type it on the command line.
I get the same problem with :g/string/s/string2/string3/
Seems to be a problem with the 'g' cmd in a macro buffer.  What
gives?  Any help will be appreciated.  Thanks.
