	Wow. Enough mail reached me to justify posting this. This is
a shar of a vi summary and a short tutorial on writing macros. I have
also included a sample .exrc file that I use for programming.

	Thank Yous:

	I owe thanks to a couple of people who recently posted vi info
to the net. A good summary came from: (very well laid out)

	maart@cs.vu.nl (Maarten Litmaath)
	VU Informatica, Amsterdam

	A macro package with lots of files also was helpful. Thanks also
to:

Greg McGary --		gmcgary@ecd.sun.com
			gmcgary@suneast.uu.net

	For developing mkid, gid, aid, eid, and co. My macros allow you
to quickly use the ID database that mkid generates.

	Forward:

	It's amazing how much power there is in vi, once you get past
the initial learning bunny slope :-) There are many complete summaries
out there, but fewer sources of info about macros. I'd like to help
change that... I'll update this soon, but want to post what I have
now.
