Folks, 

Sequel to the previous query ? What is a section / and that setting do ?

Well, this is absurd.  I don't think that there was any need to be
such a jerk in response to some guy's question, even if he did
post twice to ask two questions.  

RTFM --- my, what a useful response!  At least on our Suns here,
"man ex" or "man vi" not only DO NOT mention anything that would
remotely help someone figure out the answer, they aren't really
much use for anything besides looking up relevant envariables and
command line switches.

The on-line manual is of course a natural first place to look, but
I'm sure you must be aware that it isn't perfect.  I don't know
anyone who's learned to typeset a doc by doing "man tex," for
example.

Folks,

I am sorry about the double posting - the problem was that I realized that there
was a section option only later - so hence the second post.

Apologies ......

The problem I am facing is that if I am editing a LaTeX file and I wish to 
format only the test ( and no the fig code that co-exists ) - {!}fmt formats
the whole file (atleast from where one is to $). So, I was wondering if any 
change to those settings could help me format just the para I want ( currently
working on ).

Apologies, once again for the erring.

Kerd
