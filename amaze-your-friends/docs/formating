I hate to take up bandwidth with what appears to be obvious to veteran vi
users, but I can't seem to find *formating* documentation in any books.
Directions to FAQs/sites would be appreciated.

1. How do you insert text into an existing paragraph AND reformat/fill that
   paragraph so that all text observes the wrapmargin, without part of a word
   on one line and the rest of the word on the next?

2. How do you justify text for both the left AND right margins without running
   through fmt?

Certainly, there are editors with this capability, and VI is even one
of them, but not without calling external programs to reformat the
current line.  Also, it requres remapping keys and defining macros to
make these calls.  While this makes it transparent to the user of VI
that external calls are being made, they are still there.
Additionally, I don't like remapping what the RETURN key does, since I
would feel like I would lose control over how the editor behaves.

Date: 15 Jul 1993 20:46:36 GMT

I would like to have a specified number of lines formatted according to
the current wrap margin. I tried something like

	:map T JIa^["add@a

but when then there was a long line stored in register a, I got the error
message "Register too long to fit in memory"

Do you know any other way to solve this problem?

Thanks for any help,

PS. Ideally I would like to have all the lines till the end of the paragraph
    formatted, but I couldn't figure out a way to do it.

The following map function (in my .exrc) marks the begining of a paragraph,
then moves to and marks the end of the paragraph.  Then sends the whole
paragraph to the "fmt" or text format program.

map #1 mz}^Mbmx:'z,'x!fmt^M


if you don't have "fmt" but do have "nroff" you can use the following
substitute "fmt" shell script.


echo "" >/tmp/.xy
echo ".na
.ll 7.5i" >/tmp/\(co
cat - >>/tmp/\(co
nroff /tmp/\(co|sed -e "/^$/d" |cat - /tmp/.xy
rm /tmp/\(co /tmp/.xy

Taken directly from the FAQ....

07) How do I reformat paragraphs in vi?

Rather than write a set of macros to do this for you, it's usually
easier just to use an external program to do it for you.  If you have
fmt(1), then {!}fmt will reformat the paragraph under the cursor.  This
can be fitted into a macro easily enough.

If you don't have fmt, then you can use nroff(1) similarly (with a few
caveats about getting rid of trailing blank lines).

A format program is also to be found inside the EX/VI archives.  The
filename is vi.reformat.tar.Z.  It claims to be a WordStar reformat.
