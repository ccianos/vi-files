			Shell Escapes










		o  :sh

		o  :!sh

		o  :1,5!fmt

		Both ":sh" and ":!sh" will let you escape to the
		command processor.  When the shell is exited, control
		passes back to vi.  The form ":1,5!program" will
		execute a program with lines 1 through 5 being used as
		the standard input for the program.  The output of the
		program will replace lines 1 through 5 in the file.
