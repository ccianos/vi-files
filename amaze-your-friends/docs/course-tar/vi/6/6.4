			Substitution










		o  :xs/RE/re/
		o  :xs/RE/re/g   - On line x substitute "re" for 
		"RE".  The g means do it for all lines.

		o  :1,$s/RE/re/g 

		As you can see, you can specify a line, lines, or the
		whole file to change.  Use the g option to make
		changes throughout the line rather than just the
		first occurence of a change in the line.
