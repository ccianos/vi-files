			Modes






		 VI works in three different modes. They are:


			o  Insert Mode -  This mode is used when
		appending, inserting, changing, and replacing text. 

			o  Ex Mode -  This mode allows for use of 
		the ex set of commands.  This mode can act on one line
		at a time, several lines at a time, or every line.
		Shell escapes are executed at this level.

			o  Command Mode - Vi begins in this mode.
		This mode allows you to switch to the other modes.  
		In addition, deleting, transposing, yanking, and 
		other functions are performed here.
