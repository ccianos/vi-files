		o  VI lets you move the cursor a character, word,
      		   line, or region at a time.

		o  As with other functions keys, a numeric count can
		   be added before the key to repeat the function.

		o  Example:

			o h will move the cursor back 1 character

			o 4h will move the cursor back 4 characters

		o  VI will not let you navigate before the beginning
		or end of the file.
