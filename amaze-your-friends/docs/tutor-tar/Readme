Vitutor is a "hands on" tutorial for new users of the vi editor.

Most new users can get through it in less than one hour.  The product
is a person who can do simple editing task using the vi editor.

To install, move "tutor.vi" to where you want to keep it, and then
modify the FROM parameter in "vitutor" to reflect where you put it.

Tutor.vi is a file that contains the tutorial lessons.  You can simply
execute "vi tutor.vi" and then follow the instructions in the lessons.
The lessons tell you to modify the file, so DON'T DO THIS ON YOUR
ORIGINAL COPY.

The "vitutor" file is a shell script that does the following:
1. Checks if you are using a dumb terminal.
2. Makes a backup copy of tutor.vi in your home directory, if it
   already exist there.
3. Copies "tutor.vi" to your home directory.
4. Executes "vi tutor.vi".

I have considered adding more advanced lessons but have not found the
time.  Please let me know how you like it and send any improvements you
make.
