README - e version 1.3


Blurb:
    e is a command line preprocessor to get you into vi with ease.
    I find it very useful - even given a shell with history. It keeps 
    a history of the files that have been e'ed most recently in each 
    directory. Thus it is nice to be able to do

    cd somewhere
    e

    and get straight into the file you were last working on in the 
    directory "somewhere". It also allows fast cross-directory editing,
    does spelling corrections and solves the nasty modeline security
	problem by allowing you to ensure that you never inherit someone
	else's .exrc file.


Documentation:
    Documentation and examples can be found in the man page in e.1. 
    This is in troff -man format.


Installing e:
    Change the UNIX line at the start of the Makefile. This *must* be 
    one of Bsd, Sun, Sysv, Ultrix or Dynix. 

    [If you are on a sequent (dynix), change the e dependency
     line in the Makefile to "e :& $(HEADERS) $(OBJS)" to get parallel make]

    Then make.

    If you use a previous version of e, you will want to update your old 
    .e files as the new version uses a single .e file in your home 
    directory. The format is slightly different. The shell script in 
    e_update.sh will make the changes for you.


Portability:
    This is known to work on BSD4.[23], Ultrix 2.0, Dynix (BSD4.2 universe),
    and SUN 3.0. I put quite alot of time into trying to get it to go on
    a SVR2 NCR tower here, but it was so *incredibly* slow that I ran out
    of patience - but it is *very* close (it compiles, but the terminal gets
    screwed up sometimes). Please let me know if you make it work.

	It passes through lint without comment - except for the screwy stuff
	in <sys/ioctl.h> on BSD.


Thanks:
    To Phil Oldiges, Simon Brown and John Sellens.
    Also to Doug Gwyn for his directory routines and answering questions
    about them.
