Version 1.1 changes          October 1987.
==========================================
 
- Added "VIPATH" environment variable.

- Added #ifdef statements to enable compilation on a SUN.
- Put #defines etc into e.h as they were getting in the way.
 


Version 1.2 changes          December 1987.
===========================================
 
- Made the numbering on "e -" the same as for "e .".
- System V port (thanks to Simon Brown).
- Added man page (thanks to Phil Oldiges).
- Fixed handling of the VIPATH variable so that it doesn't screw up
    when there is more than one delimiter. Added new delimiters.
- Cleaned up terminal handling to use ioctl().
- Cleaned up error handling.
- Fixed (for sure this time) the bug with long argument lists.
- Made returns consistent in check().
- Flagged suspected unsatisfied symbolic link in check().

    variable containing the PATH for cross directory stuff. (set to "VIPATH").
- Added E_MODE #define for the protection mode for .e (set to 0644).
- Fixed spelling correction to offer all likely targets in a directory, not
    just the first encountered. Added 'N' option to say "I meant what I said,
    don't give me more possible corrections."
- Comments!
 

Version 1.3 changes         December 1988.
==========================================
