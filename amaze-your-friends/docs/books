The one book I use, has taken me from a vi hater to a vi lover. It's
"The Ultimate Guide to the VI and EX Text Editors" from the Hewlett Packard
company. Apparently originally published as part of the HP documentation, it
has now been published publicly by The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co. Ltd.,
390 Bridge Parkway, Redwood City, California 94065.
ISBN 0-8053-4460-8. Cost (Pounds Sterling) 19.95.
