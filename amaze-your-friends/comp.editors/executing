This will not work correctly at the end of a line because of the two joins.

or

:map ^X ma:r!date^Mj0d$`apmajdd`a

This uses d$ to delete to the end of the line but not the newline and
uses the little known but useful backquote which puts you at the marked
character position.

There is no way to read in directly at the cursor position because
the read has to be done in ex line editor mode which does not understand
cursor position (or `).

If you want the cursor to end up in the same place as it started:

mao^[!!date^M"ad$`aPjdd`a

where ^[ is the ESC key and ^M is the RETURN key. Alternatively to get the
cursor to finish _after_ the inserted text:

i^M^Mx^[k!!date^MkJxJxx

Again ^[ is ESC and ^M is RETURN. The first and last x are not needed but ensure
that no spaces are either added or deleted.

Note that there are numerous other ways to do this operation. If you don't plan
on using the above inside a macro, you can omit the named buffers from the first
example, making it the same number of keystrokes as the second example. Or you can
omit various bits if you don't care where the cursor ends up, etc.

vi has no builtin way to do this.
!!date
will overwrite the contents of the current line, or
:<address>r !date
will insert the date at <address> or after the current line if
<address> is not specified.  Otherwise, create a macro to do what
you want.

Oh well, at least stty mentions it's name in the message you get.
Biff just says "Where are you?", giving you no clue whatsoever.

This is essentially question 2.7 in the FAQ for comp.unix.questions.
The answer is that it is a problem with your .cshrc file (or equivalent
for whatever shell you use.)
That file contains a line with an stty command, maybe:

	stty erase ^H		# or whatever

If your shell is a C shell or compatible, change that to read:

	if ($?prompt)
		stty erase ^H		# or whatever
	endif

Or, if it's a Bourne shell compatible, make that:

	if	[ ${PS1+x} = x ]
	then	stty erase ^H		# or whatever
	fi

Oh, if there is a line starting with:

	set prompt=
or
	PS1=

respectively, put that line between the if/endif pair c.q. then/fi
pair as well.

Certainly:

    !!some_command<return>

Just like dd, cc, and yy say to delete, change and yank the current line
(respectively), !! says to pipe the current line to the command.

I've been having a problem whenever I use the vi escape filter mechanism.  The
following line always ends up in the file I'm editing:

stty: TCGETS: Operation not supported on socket

Anyone out there know what I can do to get rid of this?
I'm running vi from an xterm under OpenWindows.

Subject: Why this output with ! in vi?
Date: 21 Jul 1993 19:15:08 GMT

Hi,

When I use '!)sort', ':.,30!sort' or a similar kind in vi, I always get
the output that is preceded by '^[P1.yHHHH:FFFFF^[\'
('^[' = Escape;  HHHH = machine name;  FFFF = file pathname).

What's wrong and how can I avoid this?
BTW, I am editing on an SGI IRIS (4.0).
Thanks in advance.
