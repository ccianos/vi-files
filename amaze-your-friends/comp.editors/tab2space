try piping your file through expand.

Solution:

Teach them to leave poor tab_stop alone (i.e. at the value of 8) and to
use shift_width to set indent amount.

Use expand and unexpand to repair existing files.

:map <tab> to control-T if they insist on hitting <tab> to indent.

You probably didn't type enough control-V's.  The line should look like:

:map! ^V	 ^V 

To produce this, type

:
m
a		This bit is obvious.
p
!
<space>		
control-V	This one tells vi-mode to pass the next one to ex-mode.
control-V	This one tells ex-mode that the next character is the one
			to be map!ped.
<tab>		The character to be map!ped
<space>
control-V	Same.
control-V	Similar.
<space>		What it is map!ped to.

If you've done this and try to do again, you'll find that the <tab> gets
replaced by a <space> (that's what :map! is for) and you have to type
a third control-V in the first bunch to tell vi-mode not to do that.

and the shift key is supposed to shift the hammer tray up so the bottom
half of the hammers strike the paper, etc., etc.

However, back to reality, tabs are nearly utterly useless.  I have
3 printers I sometimes have to print to, and 2 of them don't allow you
to define tabstops (!).  I've also got a fine terminal which doesn't
like redefinition of tabstops, even though the software thinks it's
gone and done it.  I imagine that a lot of people wouldn't mind never
dealing with the headache of tabs ever again.

><shrug>  Why don't you just set ts=100, and take off everyones tab keys?

much easier is

:map! ^V^V^I ^V^V ^V^V 
     ^      ^    ^    ^
     |      |    |    |
      \_____|____|____/
             |
spaces-------/

and, of course, the ^ means 'control-'

No, no, no.  The hammers are supposed to strike the ink ribbon.  :-)

This doesn't completely solve the TAB problem: the autoindent option
and the < and > operators _generate_ TABs.  To stop vi from doing that,
you'd have to :set ts=100.

Don't give in to her!!

If everyone sticks to the normal convention of all terminals that I know of,
i.e. tab stops every eight spaces th
