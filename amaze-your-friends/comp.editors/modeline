Subject: modeline -> Modified
Date: Wed, 10 Jun 1992 04:59:34 GMT

If I have even a trivial modeline, eg :
  vi:map , j:
with a minimal .exrc :
  set modeline
& no ~/.exrc or EXINITRC,
then when I start vi the file is immediately marked [Modified].
This seems a bit repulsive.  Is there a better fix than :
  vi:map , j|w!:
Thanks,

I forgot to say this is SunOS 4.1.1 (:version -> Version SVR3.1)

Well... in your $HOME/.exrc you must have 
   :set modeline 
or else this will not work.
You may also set the $EXINIT to the appropriate.

Taken from Marten Litmaath VI refference, Version 7:

    modeline                | When you read an existing file into the buffer,
                            |   and this option is set, the first and last 5
                            |   lines are checked for editing commands in the
                            |   following form:
                            |
                            |     <sp>vi:set options|map ...|ab ...|!...:
                            |
                            |   Instead of <sp> a <ht> can be used, instead of
                            |   `vi' there can be `ex'.  Warning: this option
                            |   could have nasty results if you edit a file
                            |   containing `strange' modelines.

This is IMO a MUST of a document if you are not fully aware of all the
quirks of VI. 
It IS a quick refference, but one of the good ones around (no offence
to the other ones !)

For a fuller discussion on this issue, fetch the file called:
    vi.startup.d.Z  
from the VI archives.

You need to add this to your .exrc file:

set modeline

Every file can have vi commands in the following format in the first or
last five lines:

 vi:command:

The whitespace and colons seem necessary for our version of vi running
in SunOS 4.1.1.  I found the modeline command in the ``Vi Manual'' by
Sailer and Litmaath; it wasn't in the SunOS 4.0.3 documentation.

For example, my LaTeX files have the following line in the start (the
percent symbol is a comment in TeX):

% :source $HOME/.ex
