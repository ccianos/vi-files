   I happily encountered 'elvis' the other day which seems a fairly
high quality effort at a vi clone.  I was a bit surprised however
at the fact that it clears the anon buffers when you change files
via :e etc.  From a philosophical point of view I can see how this
behavior might be defended.  But alas, transporting text between files
with the default cut buffer is a habit I had fallen into.
   I'm wondering if there is any formal rule on this point. 
I appeal to the vi mavens here for a clarification.

Elvis' behaviour is standard.  You should use the letter buffers as
these are not cleared.  E.g. "a10yy to put 10 lines into buffer a,
and then (in another file) "ap or "aP.

I am not sure what you mean by "anon" buffers in vi.  If you are refering to
the "unnamed" buffer, all vi's that I know of clear this buffer between file
when you 
:e etc
To transport buffers between files you need to use any of the 26 "named"
buffers [a-z].  To yank text into a named buffer (a in this example)
"a4yy       -> yank 4 lines into buffer a
then you can
:e etc
and use 
"ap
to put the contents of buffer a into file "etc"
