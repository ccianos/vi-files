Hi,

Under what circumstance do i get the " too dangerous to map that" message?

There were a few times vi refused to map something.
e.g. perform search for fixed patten
:map xx /pattern

Does this mean, that i probably will run into conflict with 'internal' vi mappings?

Is there a way to do the mapping anyway.
e.g: space bar mapping (well, bad example, since it is not too dangerous to map ;) )

map ^V  something

an then redefine the mappings for 's' and '~', which use the spacebar-mapping, 
accordingly with the 'l' as substitute.


Another question:

-) is there a way to use the 'unmapped' meaning of mapped symbols?
   suppose you map! the ESC-key to somthing (a stupid thing, i know ;) ), which 
   leaves you with (almost) no possibility to return from any insert/appand/open mode;
   the only thing a can imagine, is to map! an other key to ESC ( with noremap
