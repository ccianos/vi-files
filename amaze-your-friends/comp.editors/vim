The abbreviate command counts as an Ex command, which isn't supported
fully in VIM.  I got around this by remapping my abbr stuff to escape
key sequences.  It's not a big deal.

Incidentally, I didn't even realize that capability until recently.
In escape mode (both vi and vim), you can map something like esc-s
and it's a valid command if you do it fast enough.  No wonder there's
that one-second lag before vi beeps at you on a double-escape... it's
making sure it's not a real command!  pretty nifty.

vim version 1.28, which is now in beta, definitely supports :ab along with
some other nice new features like a toggle between line wrap and horizontal
scrolling.  I too have switched from using commercial vi (which is going
nowhere) to vim.  vim has enough new extensions (cut/paste [including by
columns] indicated by reverse video, multi-level undo/redo, ability to edit
long lines and binary files, etc.), handles all my complex macros, fixes
several vi annoyances, and is robust enough that I have adopted it as my
standard editor.  Plus, if one is not aware of the new features, vim works
"just like vi".  PLUS, one has the source code!  As importantly, the author,
Bram Moolenaar, has been quite responsive to users reporting bugs and
requesting new features.  (Ever try doing that with vi?)

The 1.28 version probably won't be available for a few months yet but will be
worth the wait.

A few things about vim that are NOT "just like vi":

o   screen refresh is abysmally slow.  Too much text is being moved around
    in cases where a line scroll would be sufficient.

o   there is no :set redraw, which I find essential on slow connections,
    even more so with vim than with vi.  :(

o   vim doesn't deal well with tvi-type terminals.  ^H and ^K get
    interpreted as arrow movements.  I don't know if this is a termcap
    problem, or a vim problem, but vi and everyting else works just fine.

hrm.  I would have sent them in as bug reports, but didn't know where.
