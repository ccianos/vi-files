If you're on a unix machine, you can pipe the lines to be
checked through unix spell.  

Ex.
:%!spell

However, this must be undone immediately or you'll lose your
original text.  An alternative way to do this is to save the file
and then run spell on it, reading the output into your current text file.

Ex.
:w!
:0r !spell %

This will put the misspelled words at the top of the file.


WHAT I DO:

I use the following key mappings in my .exrc file to approximate
the word processor behavior of
automatically moving the cursor from one misspelled word to the next. 

map S :w!:0r !spell %:1,s/^/\//1G
map F "kyy@k

Then a typical sequents is to hit S to run the spell checker, and load
the errors into the beginning of the file, hit F to load the word
into the find buffer, hit n to move on to the next occurrence of the word,
and dd when the cursor comes back to the first line of the file.

Is there any way, using vi (or a clone), I can put my cursor on
a word, hit a control-key sequence, and it will check the spelling
of that word, prompt me for a correct spelling, and correct it if
I so desire?

I basically want the same functionality as ispell, but when I try
it with ispell, it always assumes the word is a file name and
buggers out on me.  I haven't found a working flag.  

emacs has a M-x spell-word function, but I want it in vi.  Any
ideas?

Curt

Try "spet", and a keymapping like:

	map q !!spet -v -t3^M

This will spell the current line in verbose mode while ignoring
words with less than three characters in them.
Example:

    Let's say you wroote this and hit "q"
                  ^^^^^^                 

The program spet is available from:

	ftp : sun4nl.nluug.nl
	dir : pub/textproc/txttools
	file: spet-1.2.tar.Z

I don't know of any.

vi is a text editor, not a word processor.  Why don't you just finish
the "document" while the thoughts are still flowing, and run it through
ispell when you are through.  ispell will *automaticly* replace the
misspelled words with your word of choice.

Of course this doesn't always work so well with email or netnews postings.

Hope it helps (tm).

Mike

There are a couple of ways to do this.  If you want to use ispell:
1. write the file to some tmp file
2. run ispell on the tmp file
3. replace the current doc with the correctly spelled tmp file.
that will spell check the whole document.
This can be done with the following map for function key 1
map #1 :w %^M:!ispell  %^M^M^[:0r % ^MjdG^M
There are a couple of extra keys in this but it does work.

However, if you want put the cursor on a word, press Control-X and run
ispell on just that word and replace the word with the correct spelling,
then use the following map.

map ^X i^M^[ea^M^[b:.w! /tmp/x^M:!ispell  /tmp/x^Mbdw:r /tmp/x^MkkJJJ^M

This map grabs the word, writes it to a file (/tmp/x), runs ispell on that
file, then replaces the word with the new contents of /tmp/x.  If you are on
a multi-user system you may want to change the tmp file to something in your
home directory.  This will leave tracks (/tmp/x and /tmp/x.bk) but they are
only one word long.
