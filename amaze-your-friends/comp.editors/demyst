I'm afraid that for some key-combinations (e.g. control-G),
the motive was mostly that all of the good ones were taken.

To save you some wear of the "f" and "t" keys, let me point out
that ";" repeats the most recent "f", "t", "F" or "T", and ","
jumps to the same character in the opposite direction.

I have no idea why ";" and "," were chosen for this function.

In the classes I teach on vi, I try to point out to the students that almost
all vi commands are pneumonic.  I think "f" means "forward", BTW, but
"field" if it helps you remember.

Some other helpful hints: Uppercase keys have either a greater action than
the lowercase key (as in a,A i,I u,U h,H l,L w,W e,E r,R b,B c,C d,D s,S) or
the opposite action ( as in f,F t,T o,O p,P)

 Mnemonic. I think pneumonic implies airheaded.

 Your .sig is being stripped to four lines, I think, either that or
it could use a full stop to clarify its rather "zen" ring. :-)

And that points out the main problem when linking commands to
key-combinations instead of supplying the commands as easy-to-
remember WORDS which users can then link to any key-combo they
wish, or type as-is on a command-line...
Disallowing a command-line (or some alternative to the default
method of command-invocation) is imho one of the gravest errors
application implementors make most often.  And I know only one
editor which allows the user the freedom to (re)define commands
and their invocation-method (plus synonyming).  Though I might
change my mind after trying out "ne", advertised recently here
on comp.editors.

dl will delete to next character left, but most people use its fast form, 'x'.

In commands that process text that character twice acts on the whole line -
hence dd, cc, yy.

In vi you can combine any command that processes text (e.g. c,d,y) 
with any command that moves the cursor (e.g. l, M, w). 

Once you realise this (i.e. so you can use it without thinking about it), you will 
realise one of the reasons why vi is so powerful.  For the record, when deleting 
the stuff in your posting I used d} and d4L, to delete most of the extraneous stuff.

Actually, 'l' moves the cursor to the right, 'dl' and 'x' delete the
character under the cursor; 'h' move the cursor left, 'dh' and 'X'
delete the character to the left of the cursor.

>In commands that process text that character twice acts on the whole line -

For consistency, there is a "line" command: '_', e.g. 'd_' deletes the
current line '42y_' yanks 42 lines, etc.  "Stuttering" (doubling the
operator character) is more convenient, though.

Plus, if you learn more operators and more movement commands, the number
of useful combinations goes up very quickly.

Could be, however, (another fact about vi) double letter command are used to
indicate whole lines.  Examples: d=delete, dd delete line(s),  c=chan
