Subject: Termcap/VI problem...
Date: Sun, 31 May 1992 21:00:20 GMT

Try again....

I am adding in a new termcap entry for some bizarre terminal I bought. Works 
fine, except that I can't get VI (and VI only) to take the termcap entry. 
Keeps on complaining about unknown terminal types.

Just to be safe, I took a similar termcap entry, copied, and renamed all the
name fields. Nope, VI still didn't take it.

Any suggestions?

Oops, forgot to mention that I am running SunOS 4.1.1

Turns out that vi (as in /usr/UCB/vi) uses termINFO in SunOs. Why,
I'll never figure out. That was the problem.

Thanx to all those who helped.

	It is nearly 100% likely that your vi uses TERMINFO, *not* TERMCAP
as the means of determining what escape sequences to use.  This is true of
SunOS and most SysV binary distributions.

How to find out from the csh:

		strings `which vi` | grep term
	
You'll see a message similar to one of the following::

	corrupted terminfo entry
	terminfo entry too long
	terminfo file for "%s" terminal is not readable


Ie: This vi was linked -ltermlib

or something similar to:

	incomplete termcap entry

Ie: this vi was linked with -ltermcap


To solve your problem if this is the case:

	Download 'captoinfo' from your friendly neighborhood archive,
compile it, and run it (alternately, you could learn to write terminfo
entries).

	If you can get a hold of a System V box that has the terminfo
of interest:

To get a terminfo file from an already compiled terminfo database that
doesn't have the source around (SCO is famous for this):

	System V (at least) has a command called "infocmp" which will
dump an ASCII version of the compiled terminfo source for the terminal
currently referred to by the TERM environment variable.

I suggest that you provide your version of Unix when you post such a question.

It is possible that your version of 'vi' knows nothing about termcap, and is
using terminfo instead.

You post here, you read here...

Your signature is abusively long. Not its contents, its length.
Please recall that the news.* files suggest that 4 lines is sufficient for a
signature block.

If you had told us what kind of Unix you are using, it would be easier to
answer...

Nevertheless, on many unices VI uses not termcap but terminfo.

Why? Because terminfo is far superior to termcap - more features, faster
access.

It may be (although you'll probably find plenty of people who don't
think it's better; I'm pretty much neutral, so I'll let those people
jump into the fray - preferably in "comp.unix.questions"), but it
*wasn't* the reason.

The reason was very simple:

1) we wanted an 8-bit clean "vi" for SunOS 4.1, to handle character sets
   such as ISO Latin #1;

2) the SVR3.1 "vi" was already 8-bit clean;

3) making the BSD "vi" 8-bit clean looked like a real chore;

4) the SVR3.1 "vi" used "terminfo";

5) making the SVR3.1 "vi" use "termcap" looked like a real chore;

6) "vi" is such a sewer that nobody particularly wanted to undertake
   either of those chores;

so we just dropped in the SVR3.1 "vi", with some changes to make it
build under SunOS's SV environment (which, in 4.1[.x], doesn't have
every single library or library routine from SVR3.1; the undocumented
"-lgen" was left out, as were AT&T's decidedly non-standard routines for
fetching character set information for the locale - we used the routines
from the ANSI C draft standard, instead).

That also picked up a bunch of post-version-3.7 bug fixes, and various
other features such as "showmode"; "set showmode" puts an indicator on
the bottom line showing what mode you're in.

Superior features like "we thought of everything, so you can't possibly need
to extend it, so we'll use a static structure for reading the file"?

Faster access depends on how you set it up.  It's perfectly acceptable to
have your TERMCAP environment variable contain your entire termcap string;
this means that it's already in your address space, automagically, when you
run your app.  See 'tset' (UNIX) and 'resize' (X).

If I want better than ISO (8 color) escape sequences, at least I have a way
to get them using termcap.

The other drawback to terminfo is that if you don't have 'infocmp' and you
don't have terminfo source (many AT&T distributions left terminfo source
out), you have to write 'infocmp' or suffer with factory bugs.  It's
relatively easy, on the other hand, to edit /etc/termcap.  One glaring
use for this is to set "protect" to be reverse video on a Wyse-50, and
