This is an easy one. 

If you have set number on, you can give the command:

:4,54 w>> otherfile


A more intuitive way is to yank into a named register. This will be 
preserved when you 

:e otherfile

you can put it when you get to that file.

I use a macro that puts cut or pasted text into the register a, with the
command [ (Cut) or ] (delete). I then :e otherfile and use  to put it:

map  "ap
map [ "ay'a 
map ] "ad'a

Try

"ayy
:e other-file
"ap

The buffer holding the last action is cleared when a file is changed, but named
buffers are not.

How can I transfer a few lines of text from one file to another
using VI ?
I tried yy , :e another file and then p, but it seems that
yank/paste buffer is not preserved when I do this.

If you know that you want to copy all lines between parenthesis
or braces or brackets, you don't have to count lines; you
can use the % match command.

"ay%

to grab the text.


If the entity is a paragraph, then

"ay}

will yank to the end of the paragraph boundary.

It is almost never necessary to count lines.  Getting in the habit of moving
and yanking using objects like sections, sentences, next close-parenthesis
etc. is useful.

Yanked text is not accessible across the files. But if you yank in the 
named registers,  you can use them across the files.

try,

"a10yy      : "a for using named register a, you can use a thr z registers,
            : and say you want to yank 10 lines,

then goto the other file by 

:e other_file

and
put the yanked contents before a current line as

"aP

For more details, read about the named registers. You can do a lot of 
intersting stuff with them

hope it helps,
