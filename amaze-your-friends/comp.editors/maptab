How would one map the tab character in vi using the ":map!" command?

Thanx

I believe the button producing right mix of tabs and spaces is
<control-T> not <control-V> as you said.  But that was probably a
typo...

Some characters are special to vi and must be quoted.  To quote, prefix
with <CTRL>V (^V in short).  If that doesn't work -- this is the case for
both tab and space -- double the ^V.

	you type:  map! ^V^V<tab> ^V^V<space>^V^V<space>^V^V<space>
	you see:   map! ^V<tab> ^V<space>^V<space>^V<space>

Maybe you wont be happy with this, though.  To correctly expand tabs,
they must be replaced by tabstop - index % tabstop blanks; and although
it may be possible to painstakingly implement this function in vi, it's
just _so_ much easier to simply call

	:%!expand

and leave the work to a tool that was written to do it.

You should perhaps have consulted the VI archive (If you read the FAQ
this is known).

Also stay tuned for the next 96 hours to see the FAQ for June :-)
