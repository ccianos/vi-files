I am using remapping commands to do some common tasks in vi in a smaller
amount of time.  If I place the map commands in the .exrc file, or the
.login file, these keyboard remappings work when I edit a file in my home
directory, but somehow they don't show up if I'm working in any
subdirectory.  Can any of you gurus tell me why this is happenning?  My
setting commands in the .exrc file and .login file (e.g. wrapmargin = n)
translate to the subdirectories, so this is very confusing behavior.

One of the guys in the lab here showed us how to do this. Try this in your
.login:

    setenv EXINIT 'set wm=o [any other options] | source ~/.exrc'

This works for ULTRIX (csh), abd should work for other flavors of unix.


	Hope this helps

Normally vi looks for a .exrc in the current directory first, then, if it
doesn't find one, in the directory that is contained by the environment
variable HOME (your home-directory), and then executes.
When you set the EXINIT variable, it will always execute the contents of this,
then look for a .exrc in the current dir, but it doesn't look in your home
directory anymore. (at least the vi versions I worked with didn't).
It took me a very long time to figure this out. Nowadays I don't set EXINIT,
but only keep a .exrc in my home and every other directory where it has to be
different (fortran, c, and so on).
This means that vi always uses the .exrc in my home, except when the current
directory contains one.

Hope this helps.

Subject: map in .exrc versus via :map in vi itself
Date: Fri, 9 Jul 1993 14:32:30 GMT

I have a question that is probably yet another vi FAQ:
 
When I do the following in vi, it works for mapping "]" to "^D"
 
    :map ] ^V^D
 
However, when I add the following line to my .exrc file, I end up with
the infamous "RHS missing" error when I :so .exrc
 
     map ] ^V^D
 
I do not have this problem when mapping "[" to "^U".  Any suggestions?

Hi all.  I have a problem.  I created the following map in vi:
x j 4dd h dd k P h x d2w x J h r <tab>.  I mapped these to g.
When I invoke g, however, it chokes.  Any ideas why?  Thanks for any
and all help.

After '4dd' the cursor is at the beginning of the line, so 'h' doesn't work.

Did you check the above sequence without mapping?

Oh, now I see what is happening.  The ^D is being interpreted as an EndOfFile
mark for the .exrc file.  Any workarounds possible folks?
