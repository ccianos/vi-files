Is there a relatively simple way of wrapping paragraphs in vi?
What I often want to do is wrap several short lines into fewer longer lines
without having to "J" them all together and then insert carriage returns.

Many thanks,

Go to the first line of a paragraph and break that line where you 
want the right margin. Then go to the starting of the first line(col. 1)
of that paragraph and do these things: 

press a '!' 
press a ']'
 Here your cursor will go to the bottom of screen and '!' will appear, then
type 'fmt'                
 
Note: Don't type any quotes as I have shown above, I used them for
clarity. Also, this method works for one paragraph only, so you will
have to do for each paragraph if you have more than one.

Hope it helps

Of course, he means '}' here.

The vi command you need is

    :1,$!adjust

The ! pumps the specified lines out to the standard in of the chosen program,
catches the standard out and replac
