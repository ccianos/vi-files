Subject: Grab current Filename in VI?
Date: Mon, 28 Jun 1993 17:54:07 GMT

Hello

I want to be able to grab the current filename that I am editing,
so that (in a macro), I can say, LaTeX the CURRENT file,
or Ispell the CURRENT file.  Something like
map lat :!latex $$
where $$ is the current file that VI is editing.

Thanks

Jon-Dean
