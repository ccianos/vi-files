To remove the CRLF at the end of a line:  :%s/^V^M//
					      ^
                                              CTRL-V-CTRL-M

To remove blanklines (LF):  :%s/^$//
                                ^
			        NOT CTRL-$, but just ^ and $

To remove blanklines containing ^M (CRLF):  :%s/^^V^M$//

If there are any CRs in the buffer (vi shows those as ^M), you can use
"x" to get rid of them.

The easiest way to get rid of an LF is usually "J" (join lines).
Vi tries to be smart about "J" and give you the appropriate amount
of white space instead.  If you don't want that, you can "x" it out
or use ":j!" instead of "J" to stop vi from generating it.
