Subject: vi: How to type S and ^Q in ascii file?
Date: Wed, 22 Jul 1992 20:34:18 GMT

I was wondering if there is way to type Q ( Cntrl-Q ) and S ( Cntrl-S )
in an ascii file. ( I can type other charecters like , , etc. ) 

Thanks in advance.

Seems to me he asked especially about Control-Q and Control-S, not about your
average Control character. Try it on a Sun, in vi with Control-S. I posted this
as a question here some time ago and it seems it's NOT possible on HP's and
Sun's for Control-S. Some machines will do it though. The Sun will do
it in the csh and sh (don't know about other shells) but not in vi, the
HP won't do it at all.

go into insert mode and type

^V^[

every time you want to place the escape character
in your text. '^V' means CTRL-V and '^[' is the Escape key.

Type a control-V before the escape.

>ESC&dA  ([&dA)

That won't work on most terminals.  Most terminals want something
like ESC[7m .  If you want to write something that works on many
terminals, you'll have to extract the appropriate escape sequence
from the termcap (or terminfo) database.  Or put a _ and a backspace
in front of every highlighted character, and let a program like more
(or ul, or less) figure it out.

To put a backspace in a file using vi, you have to type a control-V
before the backspace.

This is the vary standard way to include any unprintable character in a 
vi file.  While in the input mode, enter a Control-V, followed by the
charater you wish to enter.  For your example:
Control-V ESC &dA
and it will look like
^[&dA

Control-V  will tell vi to take the next character as is.  This is how
you can enter the ESC character.
