Does any one have a suggestion as to how to rewrap a paragraph
in vi?  Here is a line I have in my .exrc that does the current
line.  Is there a way to extend this to continue down each line
until it gets to a blank line?  One flaw in this definition is
the last word of the last line always wraps to the next line.

map	^W	J070lF r^M

(Note I used the carot (^) symbol here to indicate Control
characters, which had to be quoted when entered.)

                                                /

To format a paragraph within vi, I have used:

{!}fmt where "fmt" is the UNIX command that does what you want (e.g.,
J).

If your system has some BSD utilities, you can use "fmt". Quoting from the
"man" page for "fmt":
SYNOPSIS
     fmt [ -width ] [ name ...     ]

DESCRIPTION
     Fmt is a simple text formatter that reads the concatenation
     of input files (or standard input if none are given) and
     produces on standard output a version of its input with
     lines as close to 72 characters long as possible.  Default
     line width can be altered with the -width option.  The
     spacing at the beginning of the input lines is preserved in
     the ou
