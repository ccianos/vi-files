Once you have yanked to the *named* buffer, :e the file you want
to write it into, and just put it.  NAMED buffers are remembered
by vi; it's only the UNNAMED one which is lost when switching files.
You will have to :w the current file before :e to the new one if
there were any changes (unless you :set autowrite, or are willing
to lose the changes).

Alternatively, if you want to write to disk file pip from the
current line to mark x, just :.,'x w pip...

I suggest that any followup be to comp.editors, as a more appropriate
newsgroup than comp.unix.anything would be.

Almost right.  Mark the first line of the block, say, mx.  Move to
the last line of the block and do any of:
:'x,.w file         [if writing to a new file]
or
:'x,.w! file        [if re-writing an existing file]
or
:'x,.w >> file      [if appending to an existing file]
as necessary.

And if you wanted to move lines from a file to another file you would like
then to edit, you could:

go to the 1st line and type
mx                 [to mark the beginning of the block]
go to the last line and type
"xy'x              [to yank from the mark x till the current line into buffer x]
go to the other file by typing
:e# (or :e file)
go to where you want to put the block and type
"xp
