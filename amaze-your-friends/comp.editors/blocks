Subject: vi macros for block copy/move
Date: 4 Jul 92 13:10:51 GMT

I am using vi and I have four macros defined in my .exrc for block
operations on text:

\C and \c copy a block of text (from between marks a and b) to before
or after the current cursor position.
\M and \m move a block of text (from between marks a and b) to before
or after the current cursor position.

The lines in my .exrc to define these macros are as follows...

map \C mz'b"zy'a'z"zP
map \c mz'b"zy'a'z"zp
map \M mz'b"zd'a'z"zP
map \m mz'b"zd'a'z"zp


My problem is this, whever I do \c or \C I get a beep from my terminal.  This
does not happen when I do \M or \m.  The beeping seems to come after the text
is put into the z buffer and before moving back to the z mark to put the text.

I do not get the beep if I type the command sequences for \c and \C by hand.

Anyone tell me why I get a beep and how I can get rid of it.
(please reply by email because I don't read this newsgroup often.  I'll
post any solutions that work back to the newsgroup)

Using macros to do block copying/moving seems overly complicated since
there are ex/ed commands designed for the purpose.  From my SVR3 manual:

	(.,.)ma

will move the addressed block after the line addressed by a, while

	(.,.)ta

will duplicate the addressed block after the ine addressed by a.  Both
work in vi even though ex uses different command names.

Note that with these commands you are no longer restricted to using marks
for selecting the block, although they work just fine.
