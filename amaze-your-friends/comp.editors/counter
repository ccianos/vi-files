Is there any way to implement a counter in VI?
What I'd like to do is take something like this:

  #define a 1
  #define b 2
  #define c 3
    .
    .
  #define z 26

  to become

  #define a 0
  #define b 1
  #define c 2
    .
    .
  #define z 25

Any way to do this besides manually??

Pipe the relevant lines through awk!  (Although, if you're really only
concerned with changing #defines, compilers will generate exactly the
same code given
	#define z (26-1)
as if they received
	#define z 25
and the addition of the parenthesis et.al. can clearly be done within vi.)
