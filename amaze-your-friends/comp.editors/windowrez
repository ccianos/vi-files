Subject: Vi handling window resizing, how?
Date: Tue, 11 Aug 1992 11:59:44 GMT

Currently, on my SunOS 4.2 version of VI, I have to do the following
after I resize a window in which vi is running to get it to recognize the
new window size,

   Qset term=xterm^Mvi^M

I've tried mapping this to a macro,
but once the Q key is hit to leave VI, the rest of the macro is ignored.
Is there any way around this?

The vi on SUN 0S 4.1.2 does not recognize a window resize.  Quitting vi,
resetting the term, and reinvoking vi works.  The problem is that I can't
seem to map a macro to per
