they are (n|t)roff macros which follow a point '.' at the beginning of a line
as in:
.IP some stuff
If you are not using this they are not much use. I am occasionaly forced to
write uniplex documents which use .PA for page breaks and I sometimes set
up paragraphs for this because uniplex is so horrible but reasonably easy
to hack in vi. Of course for code use the paragraph commands '{' and '}'
also recognise curly barckets at the beginning of a line which makes it
easy to go from function to function. It realy ought to be generalised
to a sequence of space separated stuff which might start a line.

Hi! 

I'm looking for a way to automatically format paragraphs using vi.

I've been using vi for years, (and I love it, and I've resisted
switching to Emacs), and all this time I've just used "J" and the
return keys.  But I really wish there was less annoying way to do it.

(At least on my system, setting the wrapmargin to greater than zero
doesn't influence the behavior of the "J" command.)


If it isn't clear what I mean by "formatting paragraphs", here is
an example:

------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a sample sentence.
This is sample sentence number two, which is longer than the others.
This is sample sentence number three.
This is sample sentence number four.

       |
       |     I want a way to automatically convert the above four lines 
       |     of text into a nicely formated paragraph.
       V 

This is a sample sentence. This is sample sentence number two, which
is longer than the others. This is sample sentence number three.  This 
is sample sentence number four.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I would greatly appreciate any help on this!
