Yes it will, just use more ^V's.

Type this:    :map ^V^V^V   ^V^F
See this:     :map ^V   ^F

[NOTE: This is untested, but it seems to work]

You may or may not have troubble with the ~ command.

In the version I use, SVR3.1, it is possible, and takes *two* ^Vs.

Unfortunately, a number of other command is implemented as if they
were mapped to a combination using space, e.g. `s' is mapped to `c '.
Mapping the space bar messes up `s' and other commands.

It would have been nice if the author of vi had used `l' instead.
It would have been even nicer if user-level maps didn't disturb the
builtin ones, of course.

While we're at it, two years ago Chris Torek posted an article in this
group in which he mentioned that one should not map any of "ailru\_ $".
I can understand most of these, but I have two questions:
(1) What does `\' do?
(2) Which command do I mess up when I map `u'?

Hmm.  One could always duplicate the text to be filtered and then filter only
the second copy of it.  Say it's a single line: yyp to duplicate it; the
cursor will then be on the lower of the two identical lines, so !!command to
filter it, leaving theFrom rouben@math9.math.umbc.edu (Rouben Rostamian)

My, that was certainly a useful answer.

I have the same question as the original poster, and I'd appreciate an
answer, not an attack.  In my case, the text being edited is often a
mail message or news article which will likely be replied to by people
who use the "> "-in-left-column quoting convention.  Text which contains
tabs does not indent well by this convention, whether or not everyone
"sticks to the normal convention" of 8-position tab stops.

I'm in the habit of piping things through a tab remover before sending
mail, but it's a habit I'd rather lose.

However, and this is more directed at the original poster: I checked
the vi source myself.  It does this in function genindent().  The
algorithm is, insert tabs, each one generating <tabstop> amount of
whitespace, until one of those would be too much.  Then generate
spaces.

Therefore, if you :set tabstop=1000, you'll generate spaces when you
autoindent.  However, if you manually enter a tab, or edit a file
containing tabs, it'll try to display them as 1000 blank spaces each!)

You could undoubtably modify one of the vi clones not to do this your
way, if it doesn't already.

Try harder, i.e. using more ^V.  If you type

:map ^V^V^V   ^V^F

is should echo as

:map ^V   ^F

and that should do the trick.

Unfortunately, doing this screws up the ~ command.

This is about what I do,  with one slight addition:

:map! ^I ^T

those should be actual control characters, with ^V's as needed.

this way, a tab is treated as an indent.  Works well.

of course, you still have to untabify files that other people have worked on,

:map ^I 1G!Gexpand^M

in command mode, tab untabs the file.

Note that using Sun's terminfo based vi, I had to provide TWO ^V characters
