Subject: Appending to external file with vi?

I use the vi (ex?) command format:

    :'x,.w file

to write a section of text to an external file (file).
But I don't know good way to append to an existing file.
The best I can think of is:

    !'xtee -a file

where ! filters from the current position to 'x through tee.
Any ideas are welcomed.  Thank you.

It's an ex command, like everything that starts with ':'.

How about:

    :'x,.w >>file

Believe it or not, vi just informed me that "Write forms are 'w' and 'w>>'".
I'd swear I've never seen that message before.  Typing

    :w>

seems to trigger it.

I'd never thought of that.  I might have come up with:

    :'x,.w !cat>>file
	  ^
where "w !" pipes (a portion of) the buffer into the indicated command.
Note the SPACE between the 'w' and the '!'.  Without it, you'd be
creating a file named "cat>>file".  (Creating files with shell meta-
characters in their names is always fun.  Try creating a file named
"`rm -r $HOME`" sometime. :-)

No, they'll both
