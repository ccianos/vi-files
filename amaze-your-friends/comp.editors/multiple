You can always do something like:

	map q :w^M:n^M

where ^M is Control-M.  Then just press 'q' to go on to the next file.

You could use ':w|n'.  you could also do ':set autowrite' (or 'se aw'
if you hate typing).  This instructs vi to automatically :w whenever
that seems like a good idea (e.g when you do :n or :! or ^Z, but not
if the file wasn't modified).
You could also consider putting the string 'set autowrote' in a file
named .exrc in your home directory.  This has the effect of setting
the option every time you start vi.  Type ':se noaw' to shut it off.

Note that you have to type it as control-V control-M.

You can get back to the start of the list by typing :w (if necessary)
and then :rew .  The command :ar displays the list of files, with []
around the name of the one you're currently editing.

Unfortunately, there's no :prev .

Well, the command sequence
:w|n
will also work.  | being the command seperator.

With a couple of more keystrokes you can simulate :prev is you use
less.

less the files you wish to edit.  When it comes up, or when you search
to the part you want in the file, v will put you in to vi.  Then a :wq
will take you back to less and then the N and P will take you to next
file or previous file.    Not the answer, but it may be a solution if
you need to invoke multiple files and perhaps not edit them all.   You
can get to all in the list that way.

Try <ctrl>6, or possibly <ctrl><shift>6  

For me that toggles between the last two files that have been 
edited in a list.  It also remembers the cursor position.
If you have altered the current file you might have to write
it out first.

I recommend getting VIM. It's the best vi clone (superset) going.
It has a "previous" command (i.e. ":pre[vious]") and everything else.

VIM (VI Imitation) can do this (i.e. ":di[splay]"). This shows the contents 
of all numbered and named buffers.

VIM, the best vi clone (superset) in the known universe!
Comes complete with source.

(Yes, I am a enthusiastic advocate)

Does that imply that VIM has no :pre[serve] command?

Do you just loose your work if the system goes down unexpectedly?

VIM keeps an autoscript file that contains the changes made to a file since 
the last save. This autoscript file is updated every 100 keystrokes or 
after two seconds of inactivity (both configurable). This allows recovery 
using the usual vi-like method of "vim -r filename".

BTW, VIM uses ":N[ext]" (opposite direction as ":n[ext]") or ":pre[vious]" 
(two forms of the same command).

Does vim support the display of multiple windows in the same session,
ala vile and emacs?  I.E., can I open two windows -- one editing, say,
j.c and one editing, say, k.c, and then use vim commands to switch
between the two windows/buffers?

BTW, vile supports this feature and I've become addicted to it.
