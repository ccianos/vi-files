What's wrong with
   "ap
for printing buffer a at cursor location and
   u
for clearing this lines?

I have heard a lot of praise for VIM in this  group  (and  others).  I
downloaded a copy myself a few weeks ago, to my  DOS/Windows  box, and
gave it a whirl.  I almost immediately removed it from my machine when
I discovered that it *insists* on displaying my .exrc :map commands on
the  terminal  prior to  bringing up the file I have asked it to edit.
The documentation  suggests that this is the way it is supposed to act
under DOS.  Strangely  enough, it doesn't  do this  under  Unix  (also
tried the Unix variant of the same version).

So the question is (if you haven't  guessed by now!), is there any way
to stop VIM from  displaying  the :map  commands  when run under  DOS?
This is so  annoying  that I  returned  to Elvis,  which is very good.
Thanks in advance for any help.

Well, believe it or not, there is a way around it.  (I should probably
cross-post this to alt.hackers 8)

Rename _vilerc to something like vile.rc (sounds like a good DOS name).
Then set your exinit environment variable to this: set exinit=so vim.rc

What happens is that vim doesn't find the default rc file so thus
defaults to looking at the env variable for instructions.  The
instructions say to source file.  When a file is sourced, it doesn't
display the key mappings...

Now, to make two comments.  VIM is a great editor/vi clone, with one
exception.  VIM has to edit the file in memory.  No problem on
systems with flat memory models, but on DOS boxes, you can't edit large
files (approximately anything larger then 700k on my system).  I think
that the
