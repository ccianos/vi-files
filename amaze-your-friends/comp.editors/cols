	If you don't want to worry about how many columns you have,
you can use the following awk program.


{
	for( i = 0; i < NF; i++ ) {
		printf "%s", $(NF - i)
		if( i != NF - 1 )
			printf " "
	}
	print ""

}

It just starts at the end and works backwards.  The 'if' is there
so that it doesn't put spaces at the end of your lines.  Hope this
helps you out. 8-)
