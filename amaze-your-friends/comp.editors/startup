Subject: esoteric use of vi.. can some1 give me the right syntax??
Date: 17 Jul 92 11:04:41 GMT
Status: RO


I remember that it is possible to put vi/ex initialisation strings into
the top or bottom 5 lines of a text file, and that vi would use those
after reading the .exrc file etc. I want to use this because normally
I have wrapmargin turned on, but in one or two files I want to turn it
off....  so this would be a really neat feature to use. My problem is
that I can't find the reference which describes this feature, and I have
forgotten the format.

from memory it was something like:
    --dummy file--
    #!/bin/sh
    # ex:set wm=0 ai ic
    #
    # this file will have no wrapping, auto-indenting and ignore case
    # set whenever being edited by vi or ex
    etc.

If anyone who knows this format could send it to me, I would be most
grateful!

An undocumented feature in vi allows a valid command in the file being 
'edited' of the form

        ...ex:{command}:
or
        ...vi:{command}:

to be actioned before interactive editing is allowed.  However, the bug also 
permits the variants ei and vx. The code reads:-

        if (beg[-2] != 'e' && beg[-2] != 'v') return;
        if (beg[-1] != 'x' && beg[-1] != 'i') return;

in routine checkmodeline().

The bug was discovered by trying to install a user with the initials 'jei' into
/etc/passwd.

Note that the above structure need not be at the beginning of the file.
Try vi'ing a file containing ei:x: .

Wayne Allston at ICL had some comments about the "vi-startup-mode" feature:
        1)  It's undocumented
        2)  It also accepts ei: and vx: in addition to ex: and vi:
        3)  It's more of a misfeature than a feature (paraphrased.)

Well, 2) is clearly a bug, and "somebody" ought to fix it.   I just checked
the source for version 3.9, and the offending lines of code are still there
in checkmodeline().

However, the startup mode is not undocumented, and it's not a misfeature.
Admittedly, the documentation isn't in the manual page, it's in the file
vax/ex.news in the source directory, but this applies to any features added
since the vi 3.5 version came out.  (Hope you've got source! :~)

Whether it's a good feature is somewhat of a religious argument, but I like
it.  However, it would be nice to have a modelines/nomodelines option that
you could set in $EXINIT, to make it safer to edit important files, or other
files where the magic sequences might occur.

This problem is well known - it came out about a year ago.

It has been fixed in vi 3.10.  The syntax is now something
that's unlikely to show up by accident in text files, and
very few commands are allowed in a mode line.  There
are explicit checks to prevent ! commands, too.

3.10 will probably first be released in System V Release 3.

The fact that mode-line processing can't be turned off is, arguably, a bug
(the same thing may have bitten us here; "vi" acted strangely when editing
/etc/passwd, and I think there was an entry that looked like a mode line).
Somebody posted some changes to "ex" (which apply both the 4.2BSD's 3.7 and
System V Release 2's 3.9) which added a flag "modelines" which, when on,
enabled mode-line processing; the default was to disable mode-line
processing.

 Since the subject of VI has come up, I've also got a question. I am trying
to find some information about the .exrc file, and the man pages for vi
and ex do not mention very much about it. Can someone direct me to a source
that will explain the what can and cannot be done in the .exrc file?

For example, one thing in that I would like to do is have a command called
":wn" that would replace ":w" and ":n", but I haven't figured out how to
do this (or if it is even possible).

Thanks!

:n in fact implies :w (at least on SunOS 4.1.1). I personally map \n and \w to :n^M
and :w^J respectively. If you are on a Sun system then I suggest that you look in

This one is simple.  Use ':set aw' to set autowrite on.  Then
when you do :n it will automatically write out the current file
if it's been changed.  Autowrite also saves the file any time you
do a shell escape (which for me seems to be about every 30
seconds or so :-) making sure I don't lose data unless I do
something really stupid.

".exrc" is NOT a command, but an environment control file for the
"EX" command. If you look in the manual pages for "EX" you should
be able to construct your .exrc file. For example, if you wish
your tab-stops to be four instead of eight every time you use
"EX" or "VI", you'd place the line:

		set ts=4

in the .exrc file.

Hope this helps ...

another place to look is in the very well written "learning

For clarity's sake, just because something is not a command does not
mean you won't find it in the man pages with an apropos.  Also, our man
pages (although they may have diddled with them) for ex(1) and vi(1) do
not mention how to set up a .exrc file at all.

The printed version of the Sun manuals should have a booklet called
"Editing Files" or some such which is where I found all that I wanted to
know about .exrc.

:    Any help would be appreciated.

    vi +":r !pwd" test  

will work IF file test already exists, but NOT if the file does
not exist beforehand [as once again vi fails the test of least
astonishment...:-(].  Use something like:

    touch test;vi -c ":r !pwd" test

to work in either case (the ! must be escaped only in csh and
workalikes, not in ksh and its ilk, so I refuse to escape it!-).

The double quote character: '"'.  Like in this snippet from my .exrc:

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
" Insert nroff macro commands before the current para to do full justification.
" Leaves cursor in replace mode to change number of columns.
map \p j{wO.ad b.ll 80.pl 1kR

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
" Pipe the current document through ispell.
" Current documant must already be named. Forces a write of the file.
map \s :w!:!ispell %:e %

hi,

i'v got a problem with .exrc file: since vi looks for .exrc in $HOME and
the local directory, my .exrc get red twice, when editing in $HOME giving me
"Too much macro text", and leaving my macros in a very strange state :(

Any way to prevent this?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ 



I had some problems with .exrc myself a while back ....

Some kind soul suggested that I should get rid of anything related
to vi's initialization  in  my .login (e.g. env var such as setenv EXINIT)


Now I have only one .exrc  ~/.exrc and that's it.
No matter where I am, this ~/.exrc will be used.

The following , I have not done yet (there was no need) :
You can localize/customize the setting that I just described by
having local .exrc which I am sure vi will be looking for before
looking at anything else.....

Does anyone know how to run this from a

Thanks much,

Put single quotes around the +/<regexp>, e.g.

	vi '+/^[0-9]*$'	blah

Do this whenever the shell is trying to expand
something that it shouldn't expand.

Thanks to Hans and all the people who mailed me with 
a solution.  Some people mailed and told me they
couldn't reproduce the problem so, fyi, here is
the exact command I was trying to run from a script:

vi +/^sequence $HOME/.nn/init

Anyone know why this works from the command line
but not from a script -- is ^ being interpreted
in some strange way?  

Just curious,
Nancy

I'd guess that you're typing your command lines to a C shell
(or maybe a TC shell) and running your scripts in a Bourne shell.
Did you get a message "sequence: not found" from your script?
When you type "sequence" on the command line, do you get
"sequence: Command not found." instead?

If that's the case, you'll have lots of problems, as there are
many, many differences.

You might consider using the Korn SHell or the Bourne Again
SHell as your interactive shell, if available on your system.

In older versions of the Bourne shell ^ is a synonym for | .

Some shells use ^ for history subsitution.  In this case you either
need to escape the ^ with \, or you need to change the history subsitution
character.  Also your sequence will be interpreted by the shell unless you
enclose it in quotes.  It could be that you are using tcsh in this case
your expression ^sequence is being intrepreted as everything not matching
your expression.
